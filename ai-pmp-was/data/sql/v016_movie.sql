bored Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to watch While I am in that minority which believes it is actually the first _Terminator_ movie which is the best of the franchise dont let that for one minute convince you I dont absolutely love _Judgement Day_ Its honestly pretty crazy to me how just bonkers good these first two _Terminator_ movies are Especially when you consider how completely every single sequel managed to miss the markrnrnI like to imagine that in the Good Timeline where everything isnt Terrible this movie is exactly the same but the trailer doesnt spoil the twist about Robert Patrick being a Terminator and Arnie being a good guy I know that they also spoil the twist about whos a Terminator and whos not and whos a bad guy and whos not in the trailers for the 3rd 4th

twists escapes a liquid terminator better special and practical effects some big explosions active discussion of how to change the future and some really iconic momentsrnrnThe movie isnt chatty in the traditional sense once Arnold gets involved all the dialogue outside the asylum is very much to mechanically move the plot forward  The terminators dont voluntary chat they more vomit exposition dialoguernrnWhile Ill always remember this as a great movie it isnt without its flaws  Hearing Johns prepubescent voice cracking almost made me turn it off and I know I found a couple of small problems while I was watching but I couldnt remember them by the end of the movie so theyre clearly not that important  I may have been a bad foley sound on a weapon and probably something that the T800 that didnt seem robotalk enoughrnrnI honestly dont know who isnt going to like this movie  it even has a low kill count So it is time to review the last good Terminator moviernrnWhen T3 came out I swear that people forgot it was even released but at least it felt like it belonged in the Terminator franchisernrnWhen Salvation dropped it felt like it fit as well but it was an MCG film so it also felt like Terminator meets Mickey MousernrnAnd when Terminator Typo was released it kind of did its best to completely alienate all the fans that the franchise had developed over the yearsrnrnBut this one well this one actually was great The Robert Patrick T1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing Patrick acted ominous and frightening and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference

he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the futurernrnAnd Sarah Connor was buff and upped her game as the heroine that could do well actually do the action she was required to preform And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the worldrnrnIt all came together as a brilliant move with old

trusted or notrnrnIt was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch Behold what we like to call the Greatest Action Movie Ever Made and for good reason For me this sits without a doubt as one of the best movies and movie sequels Ive ever seen The action scenes action set pieces practical and visual effects are truly incredible for their time and still hold up today Solid 1010 highly recommend the full 2h 33m extended cut Im never really a fan of kids in movies but Edward Furlong turns in some attitude here with his performance as the ten year old John Connor Turns out that he is the target of the the latest Skynet plot to destroy the resistance to their impending world domination in a worryingly close 2029 They have sent a new improved T1000 Robert Patrick back in time to throttle him Luckily his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models Arnold Schwarzenegger back on protection detail As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution  the authorities werent convinced about her stories of futuristic terminator robots after last time  and also to stop routinely killing people It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together and it is almost as good as the original Loads of action some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little its a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the

actors give fantastic performances Sam Neill Jeff Goldblum Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough give classic performances and even the supporting actors like Wayne Knight Samuel L Jackson and especially Bob Peck as Muldoon What really struck me this time I watched it was how the action really doesnt even start until halfway through the movie and then from there the action is nonstoprnrnI think that since it was paced like this it allows us to get attached to the characters which makes the action so much more impactful and suspenseful And even with that first hour that is primarily dialogue its still so engaging since the script is tightly written it has some compelling conversations on the control that humans have is well shot and has some humor that feels natural in the dialogue and is in character The humor is never forced in situations that are tense unless its expected form that character like Ian Malcolm rnrnAnd then that second half my God its so good This isnt an action movie to me its a suspenseful thriller Theres no humans fighting dinosaurs exploding cars and planes and the action is used relatively sparingly The CGI is also used sparingly and only when it is needed Both the practical effects and CGI look great still Speilberg really crafted amazing characters tense scenes like with the Tyrannosaurus breakout and the Raptors in the kitchen and iconic shots This was my favorite movie as a kid because of the coollooking dinosaurs and is still one of my favorites because of its insanely great characters and suspenseful scenes MORE REVIEWS

iconic characters Steven Spielberg truly is a magnificent filmmaker Remains as suspenseful as everrnrnRating A This is one of relatively few movies that I have watched more than twice so obviously I like it My most recent viewing came because I ran across the remastered version and decided to watch it again after many yearsrnrnI was never one of those kids who was into dinosaurs growing up I was more into DC comic book heroes and their TV counterparts But I like how realistic monsters and dinosaurs are looking since I started watching these films as an adult It was awesome the first time I watched it and Jurassic Park still seems like the finest example of special effects up until that pointrnrnAs far as the plot and the story details are concerned however it is quite ordinary  A man who doesnt like children becomes their caretaker when danger threatens them an embittered consultant dabbles in corporate theft a wisecracking chaos theorist who proves to be correct in a few predictions though it is never explained why he was chosen to evaluate the theme park in the first place And like the security personnel in the old Star Trek episodes several characters are earmarked for destruction so the the core of characters we are supposed to care about can all survivernrnBut I am not dissing all of this just saying that the story is a rather ordinary framework to display the awesome graphics of dinosaurs in motion But the humor is good Jeff Goldblum is great but then I even like him in Apartmentcom commercials and it is all well done It is just that the film will never make one of my top 10 lists and finally at this late date I may have watched it for the last time Overall  Unparalleled storytelling blends nostalgia and terror producing one of the most extraordinary

It has endtoend thrills and some truly groundbreaking special effects The acting is however another matter entirely Sam Neill and Laura Dern as well as the truly irritating children deserve to be eaten preferably as early on in the film as possible and Richard Attenboroughs accent  well goodness only knows where that is supposed to come from Bob Peck and Jeff Goldblum hold up their end of the

installment Gone Girl Therefore this week Im reviewing five of Finchers movies Se7en was the first one and now its time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s Fight Club This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people When this movie came out in 1999 critics were extremely divided and the film failed at the box office With time it gained a cult following through home media but its still considered a very controversial piece of cinema So nothing new having in mind Fincher is at the helmrnrnDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story I never really changed my opinion about it which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history Usually after multiple rewatches my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch I really enjoy this film but I cant state that I absolutely love it Since this is a special case Im going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the articlernrnWithout spoiling anything of course theres a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution but never by its impact on the narrative Jim Uhls screenplay relies on the main characters friendship to carry the story forward and throughout the first two acts Fincher leaves notthatsubtle hints to a massive revelation which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act This major plot point is brilliantly executed and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery both in terms of the dialogue and the performances However its impact on any lightly focused observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this developmentrnrnNow I dont want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says I guessed the twist before its revelation hence it all sucks Like I insinuate above I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act Nevertheless Fight Clubs runtime is far from being short and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the films midpoint It changes the protagonists perspective it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path setting up a powerful meaningful ending However personally I dont feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end at least not in its entiretyrnrnThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks Again I feel like Fincher didnt completely trust the audience back then contrary to his procedure in Se7en In the latter flick Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewers imagination leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds In Fight Club that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present sure but even before the third act theres already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguerrnrnWithout spoiling anything of course theres a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution but never by its impact on the narrative Jim Uhls screenplay relies on the main characters friendship to carry the story forward and throughout the first two acts Fincher leaves notthatsubtle hints to a massive revelation which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act This major plot point is brilliantly executed and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery both in terms of the dialogue and the performances However its impact on any lightly focused observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this developmentrnrnNow I dont want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says I guessed the twist before its revelation hence it all sucks Like I insinuate above I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act Nevertheless Fight Clubs runtime is far from being short and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the films midpoint It changes the protagonists perspective it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path setting up a powerful meaningful ending However personally I dont feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end at least not in its entiretyrnrnThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks Again I feel like Fincher didnt completely trust the audience back then contrary to his procedure in Se7en In the latter flick Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewers imagination leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds In Fight Club that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present sure but even before the third act theres already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguerrnrnDont worry Im done with the negatives and dont forget I really really like this movie Obviously Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Nortons mental state every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience Ive also been through a point in my life where I wish Id be someone else someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating sad depressing process and it varies drastically from person to personrnrnFight Club approaches mental health and peoples acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner capturing Edward Nortons emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film Despite the issues described above Uhls screenplay is very wellwritten elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt Ad Astra Once Upon a Time in Hollywood which are indeed remarkably entertaining Predictable or not the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributesrnrnOnce again the preproduction phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process Finchers dedication to his features is palpable and visible onscreen through every single technical aspect This time Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography and both worked together to not only create that desaturated realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal violent bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest With clean consistent coherent editing from James Haygood the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime The Dust Brothers score is quite alternative which suits the also unconventional storytellingrnrnLast but not least Edward Norton and Brad Pitt I know its incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level In two physicallydemanding displays both actors deliver awardworthy performances that marked their careers Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals being extremely funny throughout the entire film but also astonishingly badass carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues On the other hand seeing Norton go allout is a terrific experience I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation filled with powerful character moments A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter Enola Holmes who also delivers an exceptional performancernrnIn the end Fight Club is and will probably remain David Finchers most controversial movie for a long long time With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution Fincher uses Jim Uhls captivating layered unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism societys behavior and mental health seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages Once again the filmmaking in display is technically flawless going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score all flowing superbly through excellent editing Unfortunately I dont belong to the group of people who utterly love this film The excessive sometimes unnecessary use of flashbacks doesnt help but its the enormous buildup packed with overly explicit clues to a significant yet unsurprising plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues dont keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable iconic films of alltimernrnRating A I didnt enjoy this pretty much at all but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together Its a weird one for mernrnOverall emFight Clubem underwhelmed me I actually knew very little before viewing it despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years well one regulatory part of it anyway Its much deeper than I had expected Unfortunately I didnt find entertainment with any of it  it was to be honest a slog to sit throughrnrnThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one and I dont mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific Its just everything that comes before didnt do anything for me Yet I still rate its intentions It did keep me guessing amidst my near boredom and the event is a good one on paper It just failed to connect on me in actualityrnrnBrad Pitt is good as Tyler though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion Meat Loaf is interesting I guess as BobrnrnIm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts each to their own but I honestly didnt get into it sadly As noted though I still partially rate it weirdly 6 feels harsh so I give it 7 I was mostly neutral on this movie until the last third when things turned psychologically thrilling and gave me American Psycho vibes The His name was Robert Paulson scene specifically was where the film turned from 3 starts to 45 stars Would recommend and I intend to return to this in some time as I feel it has higher rewatchability than many films of this style _Finding enlightenment thru beating each other to a pulp_rnrnA 30 yearold man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery but suffers insomnia Edward Norton Hes finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups Helena Bonham Carter and especially a devilmaycare guy who lives on the outskirts of town Brad Pitt They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each otherrnrnFight Club 1999 has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made The first half is entertaining enough both quirky and amusing and I like the interesting themes explored Escaping the maternal and material being a slave to advertising rebelling against lifestifling conformity being a blind follower of a charismatic leader finding your inner wildman Dr Jekyll  Mr Cool the nature of lawless revolutionaries which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs the struggle with homosexuality interpretation etc rnrnThats all highly commendable Unfortunately the second half isnt compelling I sat there bored and couldnt wait for it to end Donnie Darko 2001 had the same problem  promising setup with clever ideas but a tedious wrapup Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising although its relatively interesting rnrnMoreover watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times after that it gets redundant Speaking of which how exactly does bareknuckled fighting inspire or enlighten Does it really help ones life to have missing teeth black eyes and other assorted injuries Of course the movie doesnt emphasize the longlasting negative effects of regular brawling Have you ever met a brawler boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches  painsrnrnCult flicks like Pulp Fiction 1994 deserve the praise and stand the test of time this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half But its genius on the metaphorical level no doubtrnrnThe film is overlong at 2 hours 19 minutes and was shot in Los AngelesrnrnGRADE B Madness unbounded  Dont try to make sense of insanity just ride a wild ride The best movie ive seen also my head hurts This is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time stylistically narratively aesthetically and creativelyrnrnIt uses very unorthodox camera angles cute and effects to fully encapsulate this nihilistic alternative culture that took over the late 90s and early 2000srnrnIt has very deep views on early corporate capitalism which really arose in the 90s and it pulls no punches to deliver its beliefs on it Its very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to mens natural instinct and rawness Its a very raw movie overallrnrnMy only wish is that it could be longer This movie SHOULD be 3 hours But even then it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene fulfilling every plot device and answering every question There are no unleft answers with this movie this movie is completely calculated and coldhearted much likes it main protagonist Tyler DurdenrnrnAbsolutely watch this movie', NOW());

theyve been yearning forrnrnI also dont think any film has so eloquently defined a hero the way Aunt May does in a wonderfully heartfelt and poignant scene half way through the filmrnrnI do think the villain of Doctor Octopus is underdeveloped in both logic and motivation although Alfred Molina is great Mary Jane Watson is too dependent on the men in her life and the friendship arc between Peter and Harry is a bit contrived but none of these flaws affect what is otherwise a beautifully constructed film and a worthy sequel to the original Sony did a great job of focusing on what really matters in this movie  the character Here we see a relatable Peter Parker who cant seem to catch a break and when he does it just feels so satisfying to watch him rise up from all the challenges he faced It was amazing to see what they did to Harrys character He went from being Peters best friend to mortal enemy I cant blame him though cause what do you expect would happen if you found out your best friend was the one who killed your father Is it me or does MJ get more and more annoying with every film Still a 1010 film for me because Im not here for her Im here for my boy Peter Parker To me it felt like what Uncle Ben imparted to Peter in the first film  with great power comes great responsibility  was the very essence of this film He had too much power too much responsibility and he needed to find a way to balance all of that Youre not a real SpiderMan fan if you havent watched this I was completely blown away The 11yearold in me definitely connected with this film on another level and made me remember just how much I loved superheroes Big shoutout to Tobey Maguire for giving so much life and soul to Peter Parker I cant imagine anyone else doing so well like he did You can definitely feel the effort that the studio put into every scene in the movie Tobey Maguire did a great job making Peter Parker a young man that you would feel for wince with and watch slowly as he turns from this young boy into a man This is one of the OG films that paved the way for the superhero films of today I cant express how thankful I am for Tobey Maguire for being the pioneer Definitely a fans dreamcometrue Studios of today should take notes from films like this if they want to produce a successful superhero film Here in this movie we see more of the human side of SpiderMan and saw how this boy turned into a man trying his best to fulfill his responsibilities being a human and superhero at the same time I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think its one of the most engrossing superhero movies there is I really really appreciate that they highlight character development and storyline more than the fight scenes A surprisingly outstanding sequel to the first SpiderMan film All the action comedy and drama had such a delicate balance Its pretty amazing to see such a precise blend of these emotions in a superhero film If you ask me this is leaps and bounds better than the

in Black II 2002 is amusing  thrilling in the first half but loses its mojo a bit in the second half where some of the jokes fall flat If youve seen the first film theres no need to see this one but if you want more with slight variations then check it out Its the lesser movie but it still fills the bill for when youre in the mood for fun  thrilling popcorn entertainmentrnrnOn the female front

and can only recommend if you REALLY liked the first on and MIB International isnt availablernrnThey literally start the movie by subtly explaining why the formula doesnt work without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith hell Patrick Warburton would have been an AWESOME option to be in the movie for realrnrnThis is a weird one because the movie is well cast it has an interesting premise and villain and the story is well written up to a point  And hell adding Rosario Dawson makes anything better but this one just lands weak  They seem to do a worst job of showing us all the same tricks sometimes literally from the first movie but Agent K feels shoehorned in and the resolution isnt satisfying at all  Maybe if there was an epilogue but the movie is from the perspective of the MIB and theyre planet side onlyrnrnThe threat is also weird  They could have taken their time and did a mystery movie but instead they put a clock on it and rush it so its barely interesting and there is no connecting logical dots for deductions  Then its arbitrary when the do figure it out and there is no explanation of why how or what actually lead up to that  It is literally no information leading up to a fact then no information resulting from that fact other than a simple reactionrnrnThe first movie is just better and MIB International is a lot more fun The first in this franchise had the advantage of being an original quirky and entertaining spoof of all things sci fi with a couple of characterful detectives trying to stop world decimation This just drags that enjoyable concept kicking and screaming into a sequel that is nowhere near as good as well written nor do Tommy Lee Jones K or Will Smith J have anything like enough to work with to make this film anything other than an unremarkable story overlyfeaturing a talking dog The premise is that K has left the MIB and so obviously has no memories of his time at the agency With global extermination looming yet again J knows that his only hope is to reactive his erstwhile mentors memories  and quickly Easier said than done J gradually comes to realise though that K had anticipated some sort of necessity for his return and so had left some mnemonic clues for them both to find enabling him we hope to return to fighting fitness The nature of the story has flipped the dynamic leaving much more of the frankly irritating J in pole position far too often for me and Z Rip Torn doesnt make much of an impact either as we are introduced to a special effects fest of alien creations that go some way to creating a bit of a sense of fun with this otherwise disappointing followup Too much dialogue and too much Will Smith  one film was plenty Not as good as the first but still pretty good This time agent J has to make agent K remember who he is Agent K needs his help on a case Again really funny movie especially the tiny aliens', NOW());

butts What Heat is a good film but these low points keep it from being great Heat directed by Michael Mann is a crime epic based on the exploits of real life criminal Neil McCauley xa0Although mostly fictional with the events and character having real life basis Mann is able to elevate this crime drama above other films in a similar genrexa0rnrnRobert De Niro plays Neil McCauley a knowledgable experienced criminal whos skill set includes playing cat and mouse with the police After a robbery ends in a street gunfight McCauley and his gang manage to evade the police Lieutenant Vincent Hanna  Al Pacino  determined to catch the criminals skilfully assesses the crime scene and immediately  Heat begins to draw parallels between the two lead charactersxa0rnrnFilmed entirely on location Heat is a gripping tension filled viewing experience that has the viewer uncertain who to route for throughout the entire proceedings A good film with great actors at the highest level a little different from other action films and that deserves to be revisited these daysrnrnIf theres one thing that can be a good pastime its an action movie with ingenious and fearless thieves and police willing to do anything to arrest them Thats what this movie is basically and although weve seen many movies with this recipe neither does it become tiresome nor do the movies become boring or less interestingrnrnMichael Mann is today a director with solid action credits thanks in part to this film but also to The Insider and Collateral Before this film he had shown extraordinary competence in directing Last of the Mohicans a film that I consider an example for harmonizing creative freedom absolute historical rigor and a great respect for the source material In this film Mann does not disappoint and once again gives us solid consistent committed and creative directionrnrnFor the cast several great actors with given evidence were called Of course its not possible for everyone to have the same degree of protagonism but I think that each one of them had the time and material necessary to do a very well done job Al Pacino and Robert De Niro clearly stand out from the crowd In addition to having the central characters of the plot they are both incredibly intense charismatic explosive Its worth watching this duel of the titans Pacino is the most unlikable and difficult to like because he is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown De Niro is kinder and more human so its not hard to root for him In addition to them we have the excellent work of Val Kilmer and Jon Voight and a well accomplished performance of Tom Sizemore The film also features appearances by Danny Trejo almost playing himself and a teenager named Natalie Portman among many other wellknown namesrnrnDespite everything this film has little action many will say And really the priority that was given here is the development of the characters and each of their stories so that the action is more concentrated in some specific sequences like the anthological sequence of the robbery and shooting in the middle of the street I liked that and I liked that this movie tried to be different in a positive way My only criticism is the slow and tiresome pace that the film assumes most of the time With a slightly faster pace thanks to some surgical cuts the film would become lighterrnrnFilmed in Los Angeles in the city itself I can only imagine what a logistical nightmare it must have been the film couldnt have better sets and costumes striving for total realism The special effects work very well the cinematography is wonderful and the film is visually very elegant and mature', NOW());

off with a big failure Then to make matters worse we learn that Mr Phelps one of the original lead characters is actually a traitor I was so disappointedrnrnNow when I watched it for the second time

I still do not think it is truly a Mission Impossible movie in the good old style of the series thoughrnrnIt is a very good actionthriller movie though Tom Cruise is really not bad in the role of Ethan Hunt and so are the rest of the actors He is performing quite a few spectacular stunts and there are a decent amount of high tech stuff in the movie Sure some of the stunts and action scenes are perhaps a bit convoluted but it provides for some good cinemagic and it is fiction after allrnrnIf this movie would not have been labelled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it another

action set pieces for a greater focus on spycraft theft and espionagernrnMission Impossible operates on a much smaller scale than its successors and benefits from a more contained story The action and

heartpounding and compelling film Paranoia runs rampant as agent Ethan Hunt is betrayed time and time again while trying to uncover who murdered his fellow agents and prevent the murder of many more Mission Impossible is iconic with its classic hanging inches above the floor moment and established a billiondollar franchise While some of the effects are dated and some of the acting a little cliche

have here is 3 Days of the Condor directed by De Palma with lots of actionrnrnNo Im not joking its really 3 Days of the Condor with less plot and tension and more action and shooting And Cruise instead of Redford which actually is a pretty even swap from one generation to anotheronly Redford is still the better actor and Cruise only really acts when he wants tornrnSo yeah if you saw 3 Days of the Condor you know what is going on Just make it international push up the RPMs add a soundtrack by 12 of U2 and you have MissionImpossiblernrnBut despite that its really fun and enjoyable The Cold War is over but the Impossible Mission Force is still doing what it does best planning elaborate capers and pulling off hairraising heists in the name of patriotism Things have changed of course and _Mission Impossible_ uses this notion to play off our expectations from the TV series of the same name rnrnThings start off normally enough Well normal for the IMF at least Our specialized spies are fooling everyone with their schemes but not as you would expect without things going awry and creating suspense However when things go wrong this time around they go really horribly wrong And this time the problem might not be with the not quite foolproof plan The problem might not even be enemy action The real problem just might be that our heroes are every last bit as deceptive as theyve been portrayedrnrnThings are rarely as they seem in Brian de Palmas films but things do usually seem very pretty The European settings appear elegant baroque and sinister all at once Saturated colors pop out of shadowy environments Cameras move through walls on occasion disorient us with odd angles when necessary and transform the exotic into the surreal just before next plot twistrnrnBut just like the IMFs plans or personnel this move isnt as flawless as it might like to be The villains motives seem a little trite even for someone whos been backstabbing people for decades and the final stunt goes far enough overthetop that the filmmakers realized theyd need to throw the audience a wink after things finally stop flying aroundrnrnAll in all however the film does what it set out to do It creates suspense startles us with pyrotechnics and turns the TV shows convoluted tropes inside out Im not the biggest fan of the diminutive Mr Cruise  but I have to hand it to him here Brian de Palma has created an endtoend action adventure and he is superb in it He brings oodles of charisma to the screen as he Ethan Hunt has to recover from a disastrous mission and build a team to discover not only who betrayed them but to obtain a top secret list of American overseas operatives ie spies before it falls into enemy hands spelling doom for all concerned What ensues is a fastpaced well constructed movie that moves along cohesively with plenty going on  loads of tension suspicion nobody knowing whom to trust coupled with plenty of exciting stunts and a classy performance from Vanessa Redgrave bringing some gravitas to the proceedings as the stylish but ruthless Max Sure it relies on tech and CGI a lot of the time but the ensemble  Ving Rhames Emmanuelle Béart and Jon Voight all deliver well into a plot that keeps us guessing until well into the denouement Even Henry Czerny  not noted for the flexibility of his performances  turns in a decent effort and the ending might make

critics say YES the performances are as good as the Academy says NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many many times Javier Bardem makes an excellent screen villain this guy is really scary you would not want him chasing you Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones turn in Solid Performances and Woody Harrelson also Im saving my praise for KELLY MACDONALD one of my favorite actors KELLY nails that southern accent which is always surprising because her speaking voice is so Scottish she does not have a lot of screen time but when she is on screen you will know you are watching a great performance I absolutely give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN  Ten Stars 10 I literally liked the Movie Its story is outstanding and innovative However I wish the ending was more of action scenes than dialogues rnNot to forget that Javier Bardens acting is breathtaking and marvelous His smile 449 is petrifying I always figured when I got older God would sorta come inta my life somehow And he didnt I dont blame him If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does rnrnNo Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen and the Coens adapt the

follow from here on inrnrnNot quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe this is however and decidedly dark sombre gothic type thriller with noir shadings The ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many peoples lives with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up rnrnThe Coens and McCarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative none more so than portrayed by Bardems chilling psycopath The unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat even as Deakins brings beauty via his colour photography his teaming with the Coens brings visual smartsrnrnThe screenplay is tightly formed giving the actors something great to work with and as they respond in kind while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness It definitely finds the brothers Coen returning to their best as they take McCarthys melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings rnrnThe finale lacks a punch and in fact its a little boorish while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave  so its not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers Yet its still a great piece of film making the like we could do with more regularly 910 rnrnrnrnrnrn gorgeously photographed by longtime Coen associate Roger Deakins and genuinely smart but its insights boil down to Whichever way you turn fate sticks out a foot to trip you and DETOUR 1945 got there first I watched this for the first time with a few friends as part of an ongoing movie night we shared I think it was the most violent film we watched together The plot is taut and somewhat riveting with great dialogue and acting  At the same time for me it seemed rather bleak I gradually had the sense it would not end well for nearly anybody If it werent for the Tommy Lee Jones character I am not sure I would have wanted to stick with it He provides a sort of balance in the mood of the film I am not a big fan of movies with super criminals You know the ones  they seem to always be one step ahead of the hero or the authorities free to run roughshod until that are defeated at the very end of the movie if at all Woody Harrelson delivers another one of his stellar performances Who knew he would be so good very early on in his careerrnrnOddly enough No Country for Old Men caused metaphorical violence to our movie watch group as there was an exchange that caused us to watch no more films together Powerful stuff I cant say I view this one positively I clearly dont get it which Im fine withrnrnIm all for films that dont play it so straight that its predictable but at the same time Im rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way Listen thats probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt but emNo Country for Old Menem is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for mernrnI will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever they are all fantastic Javier Bardem is awesome easily the star and Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value Kelly

the conclusion frustrated me This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by and Im not usually one to dig out a films endingrnrnIn my defence even some reviews many in fact from people who love the film mention that the ending isnt perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you For me evidently not good Enjoyed it Go watch it But dont expect a masterpiecernrnThere is no denying this is a very welldone film with incredible actors and storytelling Javier Bardems Anton Chigurh stands out immediately as a new iconic film villain full of foreboding relentless focus and cold uncaring presence No Country is clearly a product of the Coen Brothers unique charm and style It boasts some tense shootouts and the uncompromising pursuit of Josh Brolins character was fantastic Unfortunately it drags along in some places but by design The ending is probably supposed to be symbolic and clever but it was sudden and lost on me a guy that takes pretty much everything at face value All in all its a good movie but I am at a loss for why it won an Oscar for Best Picture although I dont think it had much competition from Transformers or Shrek the Third Javier Bardem is just great in this He is Anton a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic Moss Josh Brolin after a drug deal goes awry The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash Moss might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally though in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff Bell Tommy Lee Jones but well you just wouldnt want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem Its violent and brutal sure  but its also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette Nobody is safe nobody is innocent  and it doesnt matter whose side you are ostensibly on either Its perfectly paced by the Coen brothers the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone It has shades of the old wildwest Texan Western genre to it it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch This is a spoiled brat Hollywood formula version of the classic film NIGHTFALL It is so parallel to Nightfall that there is no doubt that McCarthy wrote it as a brattish rewrite of the classic filmrnBy brat I mean it is contrived to appease the control freak nature of the immature and spoiled American I doubt this will fare well in the future and if anything it will cause a renewed interest in Nightfall with Aldo Ray and Brian KeithrnLike Nightfall we have an investigator who feels he is in over his head in a case of money stolen from hoodlums rnLike Nightfall the hero stumbles across stolen money and is also in over his headrnLike Nightfall there is a sadist who makes a game out of killing his victimsrnLike Nightfall the sadist has an ally who is repulsed by the sadist and is killed by the sadist rnThe only difference is that No Country presents the hoodlums as the gods that dorks worship so much rnAlso in total plagiarism of Nightfall the sadistic killer entices his victims to believe there is a contest when in reality the killer is going to decide the fate no matter what In No Country its the toss of a coin but anyuone who knows sadists knows that its a rigged contest rnNo Country For Old Men presents the sadist in the usual Hollywood formula of being immortal and godlike In Nightfall the sadist is a mortal No Country endeavors to contrive every bit of the story to show that if youre sadistic enough you are immortal the true Hollywood formula since about 1965 Godfather and other gangster movies Leone westerns almost all horror movies egrnSo we have a total lack of risk taking in McCarthy writing the total safe Hollywood story to join the innumerable other such Hollywood stories that fail to either inspire or instruct meant only to make the Beavis and Butthead viewers guffaw with delight', NOW());

mean it starts hitting them right away Were literally only minutes into the film before we find out that Neesons lead character is divorced and his wife has remarried to a decent rich provider but one whos bookish and could never take him in a fight and that the present he got for his daughter is for an interest that she no longer has But once we get into the action proper its pretty greatrnrn_Final rating  I liked it Would personally recommend you give it a go_ Random viewing tonight just wanted a slick and simple actionthriller and this fit the bill Liam Neeson kicks ass and can see why his career in this genre really took off The camera work was probably the biggest drawback shaky cam likely trying emulate the Bourne franchise or something But entertaining flick that doesnt overstay its welcome coming in at around 90minutes 405 Your arrogance offends mernrnIt is proof positive that you can still have a basic and formulaic genre piece and the multiplex crowd will forgive it the sins of film making For here we have a revenge thriller that is over reliant on a ream of contrivances The kind that people scoff at when horror pictures not wanting to be serious get screamed down for There is also some pretty poor acting performances on show the usually reliable Famke Jansen looks lost when asked to show emotion Maggie Grace needs to go back to acting school whilst some of the French actors on show give French actors a bad namernrnHowever the true saving grace in the movie outside of some serious revenge fuelled torture sequences is Liam Neeson in the lead role of Bryan Mills Charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life its only here that Luc Besson  Robert Mark Kamens uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences Taken is an enjoyable film if taken within the context of its genre and for sure the subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot but no one can surely deny it doesnt have a shallow core and honestly isnt giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula rnrnBy the by the thrills ensure popcorn pleasing pleasures and thus its rated as such 710 You will find this movie You will watch itrnrnThis movie came out of nowhere The trailer for this film relied on just one short scene of Liam Neeson threatening a kidnapper on the phone and that was all we needed to be hooked A basic revengerescue movie elevated by fantastic action stunt directing and Liam Neesons delivery all transporting this thriller into a believable

cast to play Conan I was quite pleased by his rendition of the role Excellent action and plenty of adventure and not too bad in the looks department either A most enjoyable movie that I am pleased to have in my collection Theres some cathartically pleasant violence particularly in the first half but ultimately this movie didnt have to be made and it definitely didnt have to be made under the name _Conan_rnrn_Final rating  Had some things that appeal to me but a poor finished product_ I quite liked this film more than I liked Captain America The First Avenger that we watched a couple of days ago It has gotten some rather disappointing ratings I obviously disagreernrnI found the film to be pretty much what I hoped for I read some reviews on IMDb stating that Conan only said about 40 words that he wasnt barbaric enough that the fight scenes where chopped up and that you didnt get to see much of the fightingrnrnIn reality the first statement is a blatant lie and the others simply not true The film is much bloodier than Schwarzeneggers version and sometimes in a quite barbaric way I do not know what people really expected from this film but for me it was pretty much what I hoped for Although the Schwarzenegger films are somewhat outdated I was still afraid that I would miss good old Schwarzy but I really didnt that much at leastrnrnSpecial effects where quite okay and the 51 DTS Master Audio soundtrack was done well enough It gets a 7 out of 10 from me _Looks great nice action but needed more depth_rnrnAlthough the setup of Conan the Barbarian 2011 is the same as the 1982 version raiders destroy Conans village in Cimmeria and thus the barbarian seeks revenge the story is otherwise completely different The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter Marique who seek to resurrect Zyms sorcerous wife but they need to acquire the pure blood necessary for their Acheron magicrnrnWHAT WORKSrnrnJason Momoa as Conan is excellent far better than Arnie Its hard to conceive of a better Conan rnrnThe Bulgarian locations are outstanding rnrnThe Costuming is more convincing than the 82 version Conans apparel for instance is more faithful to REH than Arnies fur loincloth rnrnBetter acting than the 82 version excluding James Earl Jones of coursernrnBrutal thrilling action throughout with convincing swordplay unlike the contrived 82 version rnrnCorsairs highlighted by Conans comrade Artus effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie rnrnExcellent setsprops it definitely looks like the Hyborian Age rnrnGood serious vibe despite the cartoony overthetop last act rnrnRose McGowan as the witchy daughter is eevil and creepy rnrnRon Perlman as Conans father rnrnThe whole opening sequence rnrnI liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father Theres a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong fatherfigure and his example of excellence rnrnYou have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conans youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general something Conans creator never delved into in any detailrnrnWHAT DOESNT WORKrnrnThe film deviates from Robert E Howard albeit not as much as the 82 version Regardless it certainly adhered to REHs overall pulp vibe Id prefer to see one of REHs originals put to film like A Witch Shall Be Born or Beyond the Black River rnrnStephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan but he comes off too clichéd and cartoony especially in the final act James Earl Jones Thulsa Doom worked better likely because he was so unique rnrnRachel Nichols Tamara is solid as the female protagonist but she doesnt hold a candle to Sandahl Bergmans Valeria rnrnThe score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris score from the 82 version and Conan The Destroyer 1984 This score definitely wont be celebrated 30 years later like Basils Why didnt they just update Polerdouris piece rnrnTheres too much Modern Blockbuster Syndrome that appeals to those with ADHD rnrnEspecially the overthetop final act which is way too comic booky Its cartoony overkill pure and simple But then again it did bring to mind REHs Jewels of Gwahlur so maybe its not so far off the mark rnrnThe biggest flaw was that there wasnt enough depth The film needed more downtime to contrast the walltowall action like campfire scenes which would better indicate distances more camaraderie on the ship more development of Conan  Tamaras relationship etc Although it had some of this it wasnt enough Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters As it is its clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film rnrnAlong with lack of depth was the lack of epicness or moving moments The 82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and a sense of epicness For instance when Conan  Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conans moving victory salute not to mention the potent love  deathfuneral scenes etc This 2011 version had glimpses of this like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conans father expresses his love with his final act but again it needed morernrnCONCLUSION The filmmakers got a lot of things right like Momoa as Conan and the authentic lookfeel of the Hyborian Age The films not bad at all and pulsates with energy but it needed more depth epicness and uniqueness to pull it out of its blockbuster mediocrity Its a case of violence for the sake of violence which gets dull by the 90minute mark plus the last act is just comic booky overload The focus on walltowall action limits the films effectiveness It lacks the confidence to chill and allow the characters to breathe rnrnStill its a somewhat worthy Conan movie Its serious and brutal and thankfully lacks cute characters Its arguably on par with Conan the Destroyer and superior in ways not to mention leagues better than Red Sonja 1985rnrnThe film runs 1 hour 53 minutesrnrnGRADE BC This is terrible poorly executed story makes no sense Costume design is nice but its not enough to sanction just under 2 hours of my life  Unless you are a child or an easily impressed adult Avoid', NOW());

truly like That optimism is soon destroyed in the first minutes of reaching the battlefields as they are hit with mortar strikes that kill countless numbers of their comrades This is where we first get to see the incredible emotion portrayed in this film The actors do so much with just their facial expressions to demonstrate their mental decay as the turmoil of war inflict their damagernrnThere is a constant theme of the destruction of peace throughout the entire film whether be the peace of Germany as a whole due to the lackluster treaty they are forced to sign or the disturbance within the troop themselves Every time our main characters have a sense of calm like having a pleasant chat while on guard duty or stealing chickens from a local farmer that calm is interrupted by more death and destruction These lulls in action provide a sense of comfortability for the audience that gets ripped away in a seconds notice This juxtaposition occurs throughout the entire film and I found in incredibly effectivernrnThe tension of war is aided with a brilliant score The subtle piano keys mixed with loud bass crashes create an uneasiness that spells impending doom for our main troop It was quite excellentrnrnAs previously stated the performances here are downright incredible Felix Kammerer was brilliant in his leading role His evolution from an absolute wreck of soldier crying and panicking on the battlefield to grizzled vet who is able to run headfirst into battle without a second notice was fantastic But he still kept the sweet and genuine attitude throughout having moments of clarity during the battle where he realizes the brutality of what he and his other soldiers are doing These complex emotions are carried over to the majority of the cast and was one of my favorite parts about this filmrnrnOverall All Quiet on the Western Front was a major surprise for me I am not super experienced nor am interested in many war films but this may have changed my tune because I genuinely believe it is one of the best movies of the yearrnrnScore 94rnVerdict Excellent This is the first major film that I have seen where the undoubted atrocities of the Great War trench battles were presented from the side of Germany More specifically from the young Bäumer the thoroughly convincing Felix Kammerer who finds himself along with comrades Müller Moritz Klaus and Albert Aaron Hilmer enlisting into the army Full of enthusiasm and optimism they arrive at a front that very quickly saps them all of both Food is in short supply as is sleep water safety  indeed just about everything that could terrify these young men is delivered upon them as meantime we the audience see a parallel storyline that shows just how close to armistice we are at this stage of this most egregious conflict If youve ever been to the Somme you will probably conclude just as Bäumer does that there is an immense degree of futility in men fighting for a few yards of bombed out muddy and corpseridden ground The toing and froing between these equally matched tired and disillusioned troops demonstrating the pointlessness of it all Edward Berger marries the strife and struggles faced by those at the front well with the diplomatic efforts being made by those whose discomfort was of an entirely different cut Daniel Brühl and to a lesser extent Thibault de Montalembert go some way to illustrating this parallel game of chess with one side determined to salvage some semblance of honour in defeat the other determined that victory will be complete and absolute The visual effects are not quite 1917 2019 but they still convey excellently the peril and squalor in which these soldiers endured The audio mixes add perfectly to that sense of menace and the whole cinematography strikes a chill The screenplay is sparing we do not have loads of dialogue  much of the imagery and the facial expressions of the young men scared out of their wits for much of the time is left to do almost all of the heavy lifting It is brutal and graphic at times but that adds enormously to this frankly terrifyingly authentic look at warfare that pits man against the elements and ultimately the politics superbly Big screen must if you can Netflix it may be but for television this certainly isnt Demonizing war leaders VS angel soldiersrnrnOne of the most beautiful and simple moments in the life of a person who loves cinema is watching this movie without any expectations and he comes out of this movie with a very high fascination I was related to war events especially World War I and World War II Naturally this thing made me related to war moviesrnrnFrom the beginning simply this movie that we are talking about entered my list among the best movies I have seen in my life and the reason is because it is different from any other moviernrnIt is very ironic from the beginning of the film and you see to what degree the name of the movie doesnt at all indicate that things are calm between the Germans and the French but it is important that through the events of the film we will live the quiet and deadly events of the soldiers on the Western Front between the Germans and the

War I or World War II is made up of young human soldiers in the prime of their lives coordinated behind policies and resounding slogans The most important point is that in every A war has victims and perpetrators on both sidesrnrnOne of the most important advantages of the film is the German side because you will live the events of the movie through German actors and this is a precedent in war

Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas SigelrnrnDriver Gosling has a day job hes a Hollywood stunt man but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene Mulligan and her little boy Benicio Kaden Leos pitching him right into the middle of two wars one is for his emotional worth the other with the criminal underworldrnrnReal human being and a real herornrnThey cheered at Cannes it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011 Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables meaning it wouldnt take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience Yet Drive is a special movie the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests There would have been many disappointed that it didnt turn out to be something akin to The Fast  The Furious 19 but as its reputation grows one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refns western done out in 1980s neo noir attirernrnYes at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture But the material is in excellent hands with Refn Sigel Gosling and co calmly unravelling Aminis stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable thats laced with ethereal overtones A picture where a look means more than any words can express a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence beating a mighty heart in the processrnrnPropelling the picture forward is the complexity of Goslings driver character He has no back story for us to work from and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas or should that be gris areas within the plot structure We learn just enough to be on his side a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles Helps too that hes so cool behind the wheel where he mines Steve McQueens effortless charisma Refn delivers magic moments of car play from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalinrnrnGosling is amazing instantly iconic soft voice matching his soft blue eyes toothpick perched between teeth its a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory Its with the calm moments that he triumphs most be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irenes eyes Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance Mulligan too is wonderful deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness their chemistry superb Isaac does fine work with the exconhusband character that is thankfully not stereotypical Brooks is Colm Meaney like thriving on simmering badness while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Drivers garage boss the closest thing the Driver has to a pal The only one dimensional character lands in Perlmans court but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the characters oafnessrnrnFrom the opening pink neon credits accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days its evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious Drive is full of classy yes arty passages fluid camera movements single takes non central framing of characters slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted LA the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman and Sigels photography The former is dealing in seamless precision the latter a master of shades a lift sequence is to ahem die for and colour toning delights Marking this out as a Bluray essentialrnrnYou can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence and Refns work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann Walter Hill William Friedkin and Sergio Leone all viable and all actually high praise indeed But rest assured Drive is still fresh and exciting the perfect movie package Refns masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011 1010 One of the best films ever made in my opinion Nothing about this felt boring like people said Just dont go in expecting an action movie 1010 Masterpiece Ironically a movie about getaway drivers and car chases was much too slow for mernrnLots and lots of silent staring Drive cuts most of its dialogue creating a mysterious and captivating main character but its slow pacing that drags despite some fantastic car chases and gorefilled moments of action drained most of the excitement The lack of dialogue forces actors to give incredible performances with their eyes body language and demeanor which the cast nails with impressive skill The atmosphere and aesthetic of the film are beautiful and unique enhancing the cinematography and visuals While the film has plenty of great ideas solid performances and gorgeous scenes the pacing and style kept me checking my watch and getting up to grab snacks while the movie continued in the background Im going to assume that this is just a case of not my kind of movie but in the end not one I can recommend Drive is a cinematic triumph that delivers an unforgettable ride from beginning to end While the storyline may seem simple at first the films attention to detail and intricacy of worldbuilding truly sets it apart from the rest Every character introduced has a connection to the crime world that is slowly pieced together creating a puzzle thats both engaging and intriguing This aspect of the film is truly captivating and highlights the excellent writingrnrnWhats more the family elements of the movie really shine Ryan Gosling delivers an outstanding performance as a protagonist forced to do bad things to survive However the connection he forms with the family across the hall is heartwarming slowly evolving from a romantic interest to a bond of familiarity and care In the meantime Oscar Isaac also gives a remarkable performance as a character initially portrayed as offputting and egotistical but whose love for his family slowly emerges as the movie progresses His characters desire to get out of the criminal life and make good on his past mistakes is admirable and heartbreakingrnrnAs the story unfolds the movie takes a dramatic turn introducing graphic violence and jawdropping moments that are genuinely wild It accelerates to full speed never letting up and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end The movies unique 80s aesthetic is also a standout even though it takes place in modern times It is visually impressive especially when combined with the superb cinematographyrnrnOverall Drive is a movie that gets so much right and turns a seemingly generic formula into a film that is truly special Its superb storytelling memorable characters intense action and unique style make it a mustwatch for any cinephilernrnScore 92 rnVerdict Excellent If you take out the staring and slow motion scenes in the movie youre left with an hour or less I liked it in general but it wasnt as good as it was hyped It could have been shot at a much faster pace with a different director Ryan Gosling may be like this but he looks extremely tense throughout the whole movie If we write down the dialogues he says in an hour and a half on a piece of paper it wouldnt even be a page there are no facial expressions either Thats how anyone can become an actor and act There is nothing special about the movie except the music I watched the movie years later just because I loved the intro music so much', NOW());

this German fellow who identifies himself as Dr King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col Hans Landa in Inglourious

optionrnrnSo begins Django Unchained an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by GenX movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western hes finally made one himself and if Quentins your thing its a blast though I doubt itll convert many Tarantino sceptics in fact itll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him about which more laterrnrnIt transpires that Dr Schultz ISNT a dentist I havent practised dentistry in five years he confides to Django over a beer but a bounty hunter and a lethal one at that Hes chasing down the Brittles a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers He doesnt know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation which is why he was searching for Django  a slave recently sold by that very plantation  in the first place Django can point them out for him Schultz is no fan of the Souths backwardsthinking propensity for slavery though and he offers Django a deal help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers Schultz will treat Django like a free man pay him 75 a decent little wedge in 1858 and rubberstamp his freedom Along the way hell also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bountyhunting both in which Django proves to be a natural On the trail of the Brittles Schultz wonders aloud as to Djangos plans once this endeavour is over and hes free Well as it happens Django is a married man and his intention once free is to find his wife and buy her freedom Theyd tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but theyd been caught branded both Django and his wife  played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington  sport RForRunaway scars on their cheeks and sold on separately So he doesnt know where she is but thats what hes going to try to do Schultz feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom proposes a further deal If this Brittle bounty goes well hell honour Djangos freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners taking on bounties and earning money hell help Django locate his wifernrnWhat we have here is a large sequence of setpieces  some funny some tense some actionpacked  stretched across verynearly three hours though like most QT films it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly strung together by a fairly simple revengerescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop a reasonably similar template to many of Quentins movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings Like Inglourious Basterds Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie a contained setpiece all of its own Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues  rambling shaggydog stories usually  to one another for context Not every scene is entirely necessary either I wouldnt call that a flaw though Id call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino whether its a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether thats an element of Tarantinos writing that the viewer appreciates Personally I love Tarantinos writers voice and I could watch these scenes for hours indeed I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90minute film thats lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are sayingrnrnPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising from stars Foxx and Waltz but also  in fact maybe more so  from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as Monsieur Calvin Candie the horrifying owner of the Candyland plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Djangos wife and Samuel L Jackson in an ifanything even more monstrous role as Stephen Candies elderly head house slave a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slaveinchief Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy a strutting peacocklike Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers and delightful in cameo roles are among many others James Remar The Warriors Dexter Jonah Hill Superbad The Watch John Jarratt Wolf Creek Rogue and Michael Parks Red State Kill Bill Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and as usual hes not as charming as he probably thinks he is but hes also not as bad as many think he is either Theres even a quick cameo raising an involuntary cheer from me by Franco Nero the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci thats not the only nod back to the first Django movie the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original and the theme song to Quentins film comes directly from the Corbucci film toornrnDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts possibly for its incredible levels of bloodshed one particular gunfight is the most bloodsplattered scene Ive seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as The Nword uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last However neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality Heads arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy BLAAAPP sound effect the blood itself translucent syrupy and intentionally unrealistic And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South youre going to hear the word Nigger in that tale Often Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic pigignorant white overseersrnrnIf you like Tarantino youll probably like Django Unchained If you like Westerns and the blooddrenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular youll probably like Django Unchained If like me youre an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns this is a nobrainer Get and see it its a blastrnrnId like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin though A highly entertaining yet disturbing film with superb cast and performances for an audience who would likely never consider watching a film fundamentally about slavery where Tarantino is masterfully and emphatically navigating and exposing the complex layers of the violent and dehumanizing system of slavery ENTERTAINING from start to finish rnrnGiven I am a big fan of Quentins works i knew this movie would be a treat to watchBut what i didnt know was violence can be so COOL The movie is a treat to watchincluding the blood and gore from starting to endThe acting is superbAnd the cinematography is just too good The whole cast played their parts to perfectionEspecially Samuel L Jackson and Jamie FoxxLeo and Christopher Waltz were superb tooAnd as Christopher said in the movie  It was hard to RESISTA must watch for everyone who likes QUALITY cinemaEven the ones who cant stand BOOMs and BANGs you wouldnt regret spending about 3 hours watching this well written well directed and well acted GREAT movie  This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time It is a pure Tarantino blast The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours almost of pure enjoyment nnThe main actors are playing their roles very well The Dr King Schultz character Christop Walz is incredibly funny without being ridiculous Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual inmovie appearance a la Hitchcock Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor eithernnThe movie starts of by Dr Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his Damsel in distress It still has quite a bit of Tarantino humour sprinkled around in it thoughnnDuring the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with let us say an attitude towards African people It is tempting to say nigger haters but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story Nothing more and nothing lessnnAs usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter I am sure some people are complaining about the unnecessary violence I am not one of those people Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is only a movienThis is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time I enjoyed it immensely When Django is unchained pronounced JANGoh not DuhJANGohrnrnReleased in 2012 and directed  written by Quentin Tarantino Django Unchained stars Christoph Waltz as an exdentist who befriends an exslave Django Jamie Foxx in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War they teamup as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner Monsieur Candie Leonardo DiCaprio in order to rescue Djangos wife Kerry Washington Samuel L Jackson plays Candies overly loyal house slavernrnThis is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantinos typical artistic flourishes It takes place in the West AND in the South which is reminiscent of the underrated Nevada Smith 1966 one of my favorite Westerns Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he  Foxx have good chemistry Theres a nice mix of interesting dialogues amusing moments and overthetop action Unfortunately but to be expected Tarantino goes overboard with the n word and the bloodletting the latter to the point of cartoonishness rnrnNevertheless this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity including stunning locations cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrackscore which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone like the excellent Hornets Nest the imaginative The Braying Mule and the moving Ancora Qui Its allaround superior to The Hateful Eight 2015 because its not limited by a oneroom whodunit plot although Hateful has its unique points of interestrnrnThe movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole Wyoming Evergreen Plantation  New Orleans Louisiana and several locations in California Lone Pine Alabama Hills Semi Valley Melody Ranch Santa Clarita Independence  Los Angeles The cast includes numerous peripheral notables eg Ato Essandohs Don Stroud James Remar Bruce Dern Ato Essandoh Franco Nero Don Johnson Amber Tamblyn and several othersrnrnGRADE A Django Unchained entertained me for sure with its taut storyline and its lack of predictability but it doesnt rise to the level of my few favorite Tarantino effortsrnrnThe trademark violence is present sometimes to the point of it being cartoonish to me It would have been easy to present many of the characters as stereotypical but the script avoided that The DiCaprio slave owner is vicious and cruel but there are flashes of flexibility concerning the status quo with his slaves And his elderly house slave  seems to act more like a slave owner than he doesrnrnA chemistry develops between the two lead characters as they work as bounty hunters and that is satisfying to see There are the usual sometimes subtle nods to other films and I felt the influence of Spaghetti Westerns here and therernrnAs I said I enjoyed the film even though I wont be watching it multiple times as I do with other Tarantino movies If you have the stomach for violence and portrayed extreme And presumably historically accurate racism give it a look Mandingo DArtagnan Slave abuse Tarantinos technique of capturing the painful discrimination against blacks headon and on the contrary making it cathartic in the final scene is brilliant Starting with the impressive theme song nonstop violence replaces it giving us a glimpse into the kaleidoscope of horrific American society Leonardo DiCaprios monstrous performance and Christoph Waltzs nearperfect supporting turn are the main reasons for the films appeal but Quentin Tarantinos screenplay which deliberately intersects revenge and black racism and ends up making us sneer at those who looked down on the slaves is nothing short of brilliantrnNext to Pulp Fiction this is Quentins best film', NOW());

did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think The digital 3D and stunts were poor Yeah there are many things to complain about it than to praise but all the answer should come in the next sequel If that makes bigger not commercially I mean with a good story graphics and performances then there will be no problem But if it fails I had to say bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series Definitely not worth a watch but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen Well at least in my opinion The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 71 which quite surprises me This was not the worst Spider Man movie The 2nd instalment SpiderMan 2 in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmlyrnrnThere are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events backstabbing bigcorporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the bigscreen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plotrnrnThe main villain Electro was  well not really giving much of an impression He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real supervillain I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end None of these villains are really bad just mediocrernrnThen of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in selfpity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies It is not funny and downright boring And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhinoas some jerk in a monster mechanical suit   What the f The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toyrnrnThe entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes Otherwise the movie was fairly yawn mediocre as far as I am concerned Having said that being the scifi and superhero fan that I am I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out The story is predictable and with zero neurons on it but Garfield and Stone connection is good and the comedy moments sort of enjoyablernrnProbably you could remove the superhero mess and you would  had a much better romantic comedy SpiderMan stuffed once againrnrnMarc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the SpiderMan franchise Writing this now Im armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017 which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprisernrnIts not so much that its a bad film or a bad SpiderMan film at that its just that it feels all very familiar whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimis Spiderman 3 Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains well two and a half really a tricky romance between Peter Parker Andrew Garfield and Gwen Stacy Emma Stone and of course theres school a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal withrnrnThe introduction of Electro Jamie Foxx is a good move inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr Freeze from another franchise Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn soon to be Green Goblin again the tortured soul act is well performed but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich  cum  Rhino is having fun but is barely in the picturernrnStone is the best thing in it by far while Garfield works hard but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are  and look  too old for their parts The action is fun and pulse raising but theres not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack All told its a shaky entry to the spidey world one that once again forced Sony into another rethink Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense 610 Had high hopes for this one because of the first film Was not disappointed I think maybe some of the lustre from Andrew Garfields first outing as SpiderMan had already worn off for this really rather mediocre sequel This time he has to don his red and blue lycra and save the city  and Gwen Emma Stone  from the marauding Green Goblin There is quite a degree of onscreen chemistry between Garfield and Stone and as an actionromance this is at the more entertaining end of the scale Its the plot and the tech elements that let it down The visual effects upon which it relies so heavily are really nothing special Nor it has to be said are the baddies The Green Goblin just isnt menacing enough That might be perhaps because Dane DeHaan is one of those actors a bit like Michael Pitt whom I never really understood why he made it at all The make up artists do work wonders in demonstrating his decline into moral turpitude but as an actor he is just well insipid as the poor misguided and bitter Harry Osborne Jamie Foxx has a bit more fun as the sparky Electro though that character is largely undeveloped and Sally Field can be relied upon to add a little maternal instinct as Aunt May but somehow the whole thing is just one beat off The first film had a much stronger story and a cast that were still bedding down this reverses that with much more assured performances from the two at the top of the bill but with a much less meaty story to back them up I did like Andrew Garfield in this role  he has charisma as an actor but this is all just a bit flat and though impressive to watch on a big screen with big sound is not a film that will make anyones top ten  even Marc Webbs I think', NOW());

to be getting worse with agernrnPrometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life but human life as well However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticismrnrnEspecially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on LostrnrnHe of course has abandoned this second movie leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan but even he struggles to find meaning here or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurts stomachrnrnWere dealing with a whole new crew this time the Covenant They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship the Captain and 47 other membersrnrnReluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey the on board crew responsible for the ships upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planetrnrnThats where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels Michael Fassbenders David the Android His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbenders softspoken performance continues to hauntrnrnI also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeouslooking special films of the last decade and this continues that from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planetrnrnWe also get the first look at the Neomorph who is born the same way seems a bit faster than the Xenomorph but the main differences are it doesnt have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human Pretty coolrnrnJust its at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these Alien 3 was fine Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels and Alien 4 of course was garbagernrnThe biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant We get a distress call the crew investigates some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation someone says we never should have come final alien chasernrnThe aliens when you can see them are cool but there is a lot of downtime between them and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster makernrnIts also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and lets just say those looking for more info about them will get angryrnrnThe promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say its hard to get reengagedrnrnThe characters dont help either as most just come off like archetypes Katherine Waterston is the Captains widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley herernrnBilly Crudup plays the faithbased character and like the last movie this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversationrnrnBut at least those two have some background Im so tired of most of these others The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration Youre not supposed to make us root for the alien guysrnrnFinally im no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary Its easy to tell what this movie wants to do and its even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comesrnrnThere are a few nice kills here I will give the movie that If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender he also plays an android named Walter have a philosophy conversation you might find some interesting stuff there too But overall not enough action or thought to make this overly drawn out series seem necessaryrnrnSo I go 510 For more reviews check me out on Youtube here httpswwwyoutubecomchannelUCY_IvAm1bJADConJhDCuq6Arnrnrnrnrnrnrnrn I had a few reservations going in to _Alien Covenant_ In my opinion there hasnt been a truly great entry to the franchise since _Aliens_ so I was worried that the statistics were against it I thought _Prometheus_ was incredible from a technical standpoint but not a very engaging movie and I was worried we might get the same here The trailers had been mostly good but I was worried I had seen too much of the third act in them and I was worried this would spoil the experience for me a littlernrnWhat I was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting I would think to myself Wow this movie is really poorly madernrnWell I guess Im an idiot because that is exactly what happened And that feeling never entirely abated over the course of the whole thingrnrnDont get me wrong its no _AVP Requiem_ but I was still very disappointedrnrn_Final rating  Had some things that appeal to me but a poor finished product_ Limps along under the weight of its own importancernrnI love my films dripping with self importance and this one is definitely one of them  I cant get enough of these films that positively bubble over with a high handed serious and arrogant attitude that indicates that there is no film quite as important as this onernrnrnThis film knows it all It knows everything that we the lowly pathetic and simple minded audience do not know and could not ever possibly know because we are not intelligent enough to grasp anything you seernrnFor such an authoritative superior and intelligent film  I find it odd that every character stumbles around like a simple minded cretin making unwise decision after unwise decisionrnrnrnRidley and his scriptwriters seem to think that they are intellectuals but somehow they just _cant pull off_ the role of being an intellectualrnrn Simon Quinlank I agree with most of the negative comments about this movieIt is a gigantic missed opportunityMy biggest issue apart from the utter predictability and nonsensicalinept scriptwas the disappointment of seeing Prometheus mixed up with AlienrnAlien covenant gets locked up in its own self importance while forgetting why we loved Alien in the first placeI really wanted to like it but came a way  with a huge sense of disappointment Not sure about all the bad reviews I enjoyed the movie  Im guessing because I wasnt expecting it to be particularly cerebral  Its a scifihorror flick I was looking forward to Sir Ridley Scott coming up with new and disgusting ways to terrorize the cast and I wasnt disappointed  Of course the android going rogue was pretty obvious but if the Star Wars franchise can feature a planet destroying space station in 3 of 7 movies Ill give Sir Ridley a pass  If you are looking for the loose ends from Prometheus to be tied up I suggest you include Sir Ridley in your prayers so he can survive long enough the man is friggin 80 to film the prequel to _Covenant_ currently titled _Awakening_ that will hopefully meet your expectations Watched Alien Covenant a 3rd time It is a lot better than first meets the eye The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didnt get those There is so much detail and such good acting It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all It blends the styles of Alien Aliens and Prometheus all together and does it very well There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2 The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special In that alone is a reference to T2 My first 2 watches I didnt appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves I was biased against his character in light of the android David The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens The actors voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T2Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it Through and through the acting is very good Details are abound everywhere There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T2 Even the monkeys stood upright at some pointrnrnHee Ridley Scott it seems is damned if he does and damned if he doesnt as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kickstarted back in 1979 Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels Not without flaws of course but a very tidy science fiction piece it be So we roll on to Alien Covenant which while not universally reviled has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circlesrnrnAlien Covenant is a cover version no two ways about it its a retread of what was showcased in 1979 only with the tiein to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress all of course while he fills in the blanks as well For sure its lazy when put up against Alien and indeed against his other superlative sci fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions you have now got what you hankered for Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed so really its best viewed as a loving retread Yes Bad science plot and logic holes average acting etc these rightly dont deserve forgiveness but its hardly the devils spawn here in fact itss great fun as much as being a visual treatrnrnLog cabin on the lakernrnWe start with a prologue involving Weyland and David the conversation involving creation the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages where do we come from Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagners The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant Crew 15  Colonists 2000  Embryos 1140 The destination is ORIGAE  6 ETA in 7 years and 4 months Only Walter the Android Michael Fassbender is awake until its time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleeprnrnCrusoe and the pathogenrnrnFrom the off disaster strikes thrusting the crew into emotional strife Characters are introduced conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87 planet number 4 and off we go into familiar territory Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion Theres some surprises in store with Fassbender a double bonus and theres some striking chatter ranging from if theres benefits of the human race and even that involving the poets Byron and ShelleyrnrnBed BugsrnrnWho will survive If anyone Just what does the finale have in store As we get devilish answers and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla its tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle Job done No bar raising here no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions just a good honest scifi thriller to be viewed with that in mind 710 Good robot Bad robotrnrnAfter some gaps the Alien franchise came alive with the prequel Prometheum which originally said to be a spinoff Particularly it landed in the hands of the original maker Now even the original title back in action Its another prequel hence the prequel series on the making The next film too will be the same kind before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight linernrnI enjoyed it But not as good as Prometheum or the first two Alien films The issue with it was the same old cliché Theres nothing in the story It was like any space film thats set in a similar fashion The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier Alien films Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals So the update makes it the specialrnrnThe story focused too much on the robot The alien parts were reduced Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films Precisely to say the origins Genetic modification crossbreeding there comes the beast From this film what I have learnt was it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct Except here the aliens come between them Hence falling prey to the same clichéd theme from any scifi that had humanoidrnrnNevertheless well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them So only 18 years to go between this from 2104 to 2122 Im already anticipating the next film As I have heard that film would be focused more on the robot Thats going to be a different experience Fassbenders time to have some space adventuresrnrn_710_ I paid to see the movie just to see what all the hype was about Its a mess of course from David going Nazi and practicing genocide to the mindless violence of an earthworm impaled on a hook to catch fish to space idiotschildren who arent smart enough to be hall monitors rnI had wondered why some folk considered the first three Alien movies Canon and NOT the current set rnIm with the three and done crowd this movie is a Hollyweird popcorm flick rnDo not watch this movie God complexes and stupidity abound Stay away if you value your peace of mind Repeating acoustic beacon Though Michael Fassbender did a sublime job and the movie itself was visually immersive the actions of the main characters did not seem very smart I could forgive the decision that the newly installed captain Oram Billy Crudup took about going to the unknown planet But everything that happened after David cut his hair exactly the same way Walter head just makes you shake your head in amusement and think Oh come on rnDavid obsessed with the act of creation that had value in its end uses any means available It is remarkable that no one from the remaining crew has questioned imposter Walterss identity and just carried on like the worst was left behind Meanwhile the last scene when Daniels Katherine Waterston realizes finally that Walter is in fact David and she had totally screwed up with the thousands of colonizers and embryos on the ship does give you slight goosebumps I would hate to be in the shoes of a filmmaker that needs to please a rabid fan base The Star Wars sequels are a perfect example of this Ridley Scott has the same challenge with the Alien prequels which you see in user scores rnrnI loved Prometheus with its attempt at something bigger than just more face huggers and xenomorphs wreaking havoc It was clear he was building a grander story to the eventual bridge to the original Alien   rnrnHe continues that bigger story with Alien Covenant and whether he meant to provide fan service or not we get that with face huggers and xenomorphs No spoiler as both are in the trailers rnrnDo yourself a favor and watch the short clip Last Supper youtubeEkXgRlRao5I  before you watch the movie At only five minutes it gives a better introduction of the Covenant crew than the movie does providing deeper emotional investment in these characters  rnrnUltimately Alien Covenant delivers an excellent fastpaced scifi action horror thriller yes it hits that many genres like only Ridley Scott can that continues exploring the Prometheus theme of creation I like how gory emAlien Covenantem is though apart from that there isnt much to shout about Its good but thats itrnrnId say its one of the weaker cast lists of the franchise not that I have anything against the performances here but I wasnt blown away or overly interested in anyone in this 2017 production Michael Fassbender is the obvious standout from an acting viewpoint though I dont really dig his character all that much to be honest The rest are a bit forgettablernrnYou can tell its well made and it does look the part with it being worth the watch to complete the franchise and all that Of the sixth films though itd be in my personal bottom two emexcl short filmsem  in fairness that isnt as bad as it sounds its just the series has seen better Initially I thought this was just a pretty shameless attempt to attach the Alien brand to the really mediocre Prometheus 2012 but to be fair it is just a little more than that The crew of a colonial exploration ship are heading to a new word when their crew are tempted by a bit of John Denver and divert to a seemingly far more suitable planet Of course once they land they begin to realise that nothing is as idyllic as they had hoped and getting off as soon as possible is now the order of the day Its almost 40 years since the first film of this strand and that renders most of the shock value pretty impotent We have all already been through the gamut of terror that these stories deliver and even though Sir Ridley Scott is an old hand at creating a sense of menace its all just a bit so what with this predictable plot that ends then it ends then it ends Michael Fassbender is quite effective as David but the rest of the cast including the usually reliable Billy Crudup have little by way of original substance to get their teeth into It is certainly a good looking film but thats what is expected it is the derivative storyline that lets it down Indeed it did remind me of an old Star Trek episode with some mythological Sirens thrown in for good measure Still it is quite watchable just not a film I expect you will ever remember Well its slightly better than Prometheus thats something Its a little bit closer to the monster movie that was Alienbut closer does not mean that it comes anywhere near being as epic as its 1979 motherqueenwhateverrnrnIts still putting on airs Its still living under the delusion that its something closer to Chinatown than well a monster movie in spacernrnI dont want to see an Alien movie that thinks its Raging Bull It doesnt really work that way I want to see and Alien movie that knows its an Alien moviernrnSimplify Man Youre a monster movie in spacemost of the timeand a space marine movie the rest of the time Either way you have no reason to throw so much crap against the wall You dont need it all to stickrnrnYoure an Alien movie you dont need to be deep you just need to be scary thats all you need to do And maybe have Ripley because she rockedrnrnBut honestly the Alien movies are monster moviesrnrnThese films have forgotten that Good Scifi rnrn With strengths at a visual and technical level it would be much better with a more developed and better written scriptrnrnI dont know if Im the only person to say this but I think a horror movie works better if we see some intelligence in the script and in the characters attitudes and if the main antagonist is mysterious and able to surprise us I liked Prometheus a film better than expected albeit with a confusing script This film establishes a clearer more palpable link between that film and the Alien franchise The script accompanies the Covenant a colony ship filled with people in hypersleep The ship receives a mysterious signal from a planet that by all indications has excellent conditions for life but quickly realizes that it has stumbled on a place where it should never have landed After seeing the film I had the feeling that we were looking at a very solid work that only lost when compared to the original franchise Perhaps the best way to be fair is really to avoid this comparative exercise which is seductive and almost impossible not to dornrnShall we start with the good things Very good The film is a sight for sore eyes especially for scifi fans and for those who like very visual films with high doses of special effects CGI or extraordinarily detailed scenarios There is no doubt that the budget had a generous slice set aside for computer technicians art and costume designers and cinematography and this investment has paid off handsomely Everything is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and good sound effects And of course there are lots of tense scenes It is one of those films where the tension is permanent but which never really scares usrnrnSadly thats basically all this movie has to offer us Fans of the Alien franchise will ensure that the film clarifies several gray points in the narrative of other films such as Prometheus and I agree with this argument but this does not seem to me to be something that we should overestimate because it really was the least that could be done demanded from this film At the script level it is frankly disappointing in addition to being lazy making the most of what was done for the other films with which it is linked it adds few new things Yes it creates some new creatures cousins of the original xenomorph but thats all The human or semihuman characters are silly devoid of development and seem to be waiting to be killedrnrnThe film starts out great but becomes slow and tiresome as it becomes predictable I have a high regard for Ridley Scotts work I think hes a very skilled and credited director but its hard not to acknowledge that he failed here The director was dazzled by the amount of CGI potential and neglected the narrative editing and direction of the actors Among the actors Michael Fassbender stands out the most The actor has given us one of his best works so far Katherine Waterston also did a very good job The rest of the cast doesnt have the time or material to do anything special', NOW());

bottom line the venomous President Snow needs to be cut down in his treacherous tracksplain and simple rnrnQuite frankly the beleaguered Katniss is caught up in the complicated web of a couple of political powerhouses in the insufferable Snow that wants to destroy her and Coin that wants to use her reputation for marketing purposes willing to go at it while using Katnisss exposed neck as the sacrificial pawn to determine their sense of twisted greatness For the most part The Hunger Games MockingjayPart 2 does present a skillful display of confusion and identity and Lawrences deathdodging diva Katniss Everdeen is the epitome of a Girl on Fire with flames of indecision and doubt burning all around her Who can she trust Who has the fortitude to stick with the plan and ensure that the tedious target of Snow is silenced for sure Can Katniss overcome the obstacles of her great love Peetas perverse distaste for her while battling one narcissistic leader as another one she is joined at the hip exploits her presence There seems to be a constant continuity for conflict in warfare and wounded souls that elevates MockingjayPart 2 as a boisterous board game of physical and psychological movement As usual Lawrences Katniss carries the animated strife on her dainty yet athletic shoulders with bouncy boldness rnrnAfter four exhilarating films The Hunger Games empire does not crumble but comes to a full scale halt as it understands the allegory claims for the distrusting contemporary times we all live in regarding the cynicism abuse of privilege and the underestimation of the weary masses being led astray by the controlling elite of unassuming movers and shakers The audacity of The Hunger Games odyssey was to get down and dirty about the giveandtake tendencies of a global society willing to challenge the authoritative scrutiny or kneel at its merciless ankles Perhaps MockingjayPart 2 should not be perceived so deeply in its final revelation Nevertheless the effort in trying to do so should be acknowledged for an actioner that dared to approach such thoughtprovoking fodder within its bombastic boundaries rnrnThe Hunger Games MockingjayPart 2 2015rnrnLionsgate

book The Hobbit was extended to three movies then thats alright because that was a large concept with hundreds of unique characters which can take the stretch in narration But for this series lucky to

Because the 80 of the story ended in the previous part and in this it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lagrnrnMight have been a better film if the Mockingjay was a single movie Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two andor three This culture has to stop the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtimernrnDue to the circumstances that I mentioned the flow was disturbed mainly because of the release gap between the last two films Emotions are not felt actions were weakened you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion And that section should have been the ultimatum what comes later is what we call happily ever after or the other way should have been very brief but in here it was not Like a new beginning of a new story it went on too farrnrnFrom the screenwriters perspective that has to be done I had seen the split movies like Twilight Harry Potter and others but this one was the worst among them Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slownessrnrn510 Well that was rather disappointing unfortunately Not that I can say that I am very surprised though The first installment in the series started off being okayish and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity  This the final installment is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really arernrnThis one was downright boring There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming

much effort The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent itrnrnThere is really only two things that I liked about this movie One is that Donald Sutherland was really good The other is the ending which although being 100 predictable was quite satisfying Well that scene everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to is where I consider the movie to have ended After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining So finally  we reach the denouement The ambitious and devious President Coin Julianne Moore thinks that the District 13 rebels have the upper hand and so using Katniss Jennifer Lawrence as their poster girl sets off to storm the very heart of the Capitol and depose the now very much weakened Snow Donald Sutherland who is clearly not in the best of health What now ensues are a series of setpiece occasionally moralebuilding but entirely predictable escapades that I have to say by now I had really lost interest in Who did what to whom in this overlong and really pretty procedural franchise was really beginning to matter less and less What made the characterisations interesting and quirky at the beginning now just makes them rather dull Peeta Josh Hutcherson features sparingly as he needs rescuing from the nasty government who are clearly drugging him up to his eyeballs and using as their Lord Haw Haw figure whilst hunky Gale Liam Hemsworth has little more to do than outrun some rather clunky special effects some extras from an as yet unmade Alien film and look good wet  a task he manages well enough now and again Its an action movie so no point trying to scrutinise the merits of the dialogue Otherwise this was more of a

movie But there should be more puzzles in the climax But I really love the movie Excellent Ive never been a fan of this series The only impressive thing of the original was the graphics that were at the time breathtaking But we all know great graphics alone cant save a film rnI watched this new effort just to see how far CGI has come in the time since the original and I can safely say not very far From the opening scene with the terrible looking and poorly animated bird its obvious that CGI has reached its limits in recreating realistic content rnAs for the film The dreadful script and annoying characters helped me lose any interest after about 15 mins Ok for the age range its aimed at I suppose but there are far better films out there worthy of your money Untamable DevilrnrnOne thing that would be 100 guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World is that whatever the quality or lack of the notices would be mixed Thus the reactions would be akin to those that Indiana Jones 4 received charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etcrnrnJurassic World does exactly what is expected of it its a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun complete with outstanding effects monster mayhem and moments of dumbness In fact its very much a safe sequel reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielbergs deft touchrnrnTheres a likable

daft almost as daft as Bryces high heels character arc and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times but its a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like its some sort of

good Everyone else was pointlessrnrnNo where near the first I would even prefer to watch Jurassic Park 3 than thisrnrn Jurassic World A Jurassic DisappointmentrnrnAs a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise especially the first movie I am quite disappointed with Jurassic World I was honestly super stoked for the longawaited sequel to Jurassic Park but in the end the movie lacked the charm and mysticism from Jurassic Park From poorlydeveloped characters with the exception of Chris Pratts Owen Grady to idiotic plot elements Jurassic Worlds only saving grace is the fact that its a sequel to Jurassic Park rnrnThe dinosaurs honestly look awful and pale in comparison to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park The CGI is so obvious and doesnt look realistic at all Jurassic Park found the right balance of practical effects and computergenerated imagery giving viewers the feeling that the dinosaurs feel so lifelike Jurassic World basically uses minimal practical effects in favor of CGI galore Its sad that a 1993 movie has better CGI than a movie made in 2015rnrnClaire and her nephews Gray and Zach are cheap imitations of John Hammond and his grandchildren Tim and Lex Claire is primarily motivated by greed and exploiting the dinosaurs Hoskins just wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons Dr Henry Wu is a bit more antagonistic revealed to be secretly creating hybrids for Hoskins as military weapons The only character thats given some form of development is Owen Grady played by StarLord aka Chris Pratt His motivations are for researching Velociraptor behavior and actually treats the dinosaurs like living creatures and not just exploited science experiments Honestly the only redeeming factor throughout the entire moviernrnThe Indominus Rex tricks the personnel into thinking its escaped confinement by clawing away at the top of its enclosure They somehow believe the dinosaur escaped but wouldnt security be alerted right away The enclosure doesnt come equipped with bells and whistles To much surprise not the Indominus is actually inside the enclosure with them This idiotic plot choice allows the Indominus to escapernrnZack and Grey revisiting the original site of Jurassic Park brought back so many nostalgic memories of Jurassic Park One of the best moments of the entire movie absolutely loved when they picked up the Jurassic Park banner and the goggles used by Tim But what killed the moment was when they managed to get the original Jeep started Its been sitting for over 20 years nonoperational But for plot convenience they learned how to fix vehicles previously rnrnI thought the assault upon the park attendees by the pterosaurs was chilling swooping up people in the process Gave a sense of terror that you could actually feel One of those people being Zara Claires assistant She is attacked by a pteranodon and then eventually eaten alive by the mosasaurus Her death was just way too drawn out and totally undeserving A death like this should have been reserved for the villainrnrnThe final battle between the Indominus Rex and Owens pack of surviving Velociraptor brought me back to the battle between the TRex and raptors in Jurassic Park Then Claire brings out the TRex the very same one from Jurassic Park and manages to outrun the TRex IN HEELS I was rooting for the TRex to win then the Mosasaurus swoops up and drags the Indominus into the lagoon rnrnThough this movie attempts to bring back the Jurassic Park charm it ultimately fails to capture that same magic Unlike The Force Awakens another similar movie that calls back to its roots Jurassic World managed to be much worse than its source material You feel no true connection to the characters or dinosaurs the excitement factor is gone and the music is not memorable at all rnrnMy Rating 55100 Most assuredly the best sequel to _Jurassic Park_ but it doesnt touch the original Not being as good as a different movie is not whats bad about _Jurassic World_ though what is though is the dropped plotlines unlikeable characters haphazard mixing of respect and disrespect for the original at random intervals a complete lack of chemistry between any two characters whatsoever but most of all the romantic leads underdeveloped arcs of both characters and story more Deus Ex Machinas than you can shake a stick at and some of the most painful dialogue Ive seen in a Hollywood flick all yearrnrnBut theres Bryce Dallas Howard proving when given the chance shes an acting force which was a particularly pleasant surprise given that the last thing I saw her in was _SpiderMan 3_ Chris Pratt doesnt for a moment make you believe he is anyone other than Chris Pratt but Chris Pratt is a pretty rad dude so thats more or less a chip in the films favourrnrnIt also has dinosaurs so theres thatrnrn_Final rating ½  Had a lot that appealed to me didnt quite work as a whole_ MORE REVIEWS  httpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnJurassic World remains my second favorite film of the whole sagarnrnColin Trevorrow is able to blend the suspenseful traits of the original with a more adventurous light tone really well Dinosaurs look amazing still today Characters could have benefited from a little more work Decent storyrnrnRating B I recently watched the first three movies in this series for the third time or so but it occurred to me as I watched this one that I probably watched it only once if at allrnrnIt brings with it the usual elements of this film franchise the children not the thousand extras who run around but two we care about whose mission is to get themselves into the path of extreme danger the somewhat evil guy who presumably will also end up being Dino food raptors who get smarter and stronger with every film and footage of the original Jurassic theme park in case we are in danger of forgetting its rootsrnrnI try not to notice stuff like how extras can never outrun dinosaurs but the stars always manage it  It is just entertainment after all Lets not overthink it And I question whether a company that must be so susceptible to lawsuits in its day to day operation would really create more dangerous creatures because they need new thrill rides Wouldnt they be more apt to create more up close and personal rides or experiences with the existing ones Especially the herbivores If a customer needs more excitement than standing near a 100foot tall dinosaur maybe they need to scale back their drug intake or go climb Mt Everest But again I dont want to overthink this thing It was watchable enough just not thought provoking or revolutionary Jurassic World captures the delight and suspense of the original films while adding a fantastic new cast an epic new park and bigger scarier dinosaursrnrnJurassic World perfectly blends the nostalgia of the original movies with a new grand scale incredible effects and big stars Hollywoods flood of reboots and remakes rarely capture the heart and quality of the original source but Jurassic World stands out as one of the best Chris Pratts tough and lovable rogue Owen Grady brings the action At the same time Bryce Dallas Howards highstung and successful business executive Claire Dearing grows and develops from selfish career focus to respecting nature and valuing family Every scene feels grandiose and epic with a bigger park bigger attractions and bigger dinosaurs The childlike wonder still shines through with kids giddy at a dino petting zoo and crowds cheering as the Mosasaurus feeds on a great white shark The scares are back too with deadlier predators and plenty of hapless park employees to hunt While the Jurassic series has its ups and downs Jurassic World is at its peak They rebuild the theme park and claim its safe You cant keep a bunch of Godzilla

superhero team movie Its really being unfairly trashed by the critics Its not up to the excellence of this summers Wonder Woman film but its quite fun to watch What made this film better than some of the other previous DCEU films is that it has a sense of humor Previous films were rightfully criticized for being too dark and humorless Gal Gadot is the stand out as Wonder Woman This film did a better job in its portrayal with Superman In Man of Steel he battled Zod which resulted in massive human casualties without a care which does not fit the character at all That made me mad as a Superman fan Here he shows concern for innocent civilians flying away with an entire building of people to make sure they would not be harmed in the battle against the villain The one weak spot is the Big Bad Steppenwolf Hes a rather fake looking CGI creation that lacks depth But hes only the precursor to the REAL villainDarkseid The two end credit scenes are entertaining The last one teasing the formation of the Legion of Doom Injustice League is particularly intriguing though thanks to bad reviews I wasnt sure about seeing this one but let me tell you my worries were put to rest very very soon this was one of the best times I have had at the movies this year the critics really missed the mark here I loved all the action and even the humor it was a good family movie as long as you have older kids due to the fact that the villans could be very frightening in spots and also this has a high level of action and it could overwhelm the youngest of kids but I still say get some snacks from the snack bar and be ready to have a super fun time at the movies with the entire family this thanksgiving weekend whether you go alone or take a group this is the movie to see When it was first announced that 2016 would see _Batman V Superman_ and _Suicide Squad_ movies I said to myself Okay I didnt like _Man of Steel_ but theres two very different DC entries coming up Ill watch both of them

rnrnrnYet again a new DC installment from one of the most controversial directors of Hollywood Zack Snyder who directed Man of Steel 2013 and Dawn of Justice 2016 The large of number of nerds around the globe are waiting for this from the childhood to see their favorite iconic heroes team up for the first time in Cinematic history The basic plot of movie revolves around some deadly external threat wanting to conquer earth like every other CBM adaptations The movie offers the same story as we see in most of the fandoms where a group of lonesome warriors come together to save earthrnrnMen are still good deeply inspired by the Superman Batman has again gained his faith in humanity and wants to start working for it and saving it The Batman continuing its investigation on what Lex Luthor was planning to do in Dawn in Justice Diana and him are uniting some new members like Victor Stone Aka Cyborg and Arthur Curry aka Aquaman and Barry Allen aka Flash in order to find their potential for good and unite against common threats when the world need itThe movie shows how people who lives alone finds it hard to adjust among new people One of most important part of the movie is The Superman in his full character development and showing to audience that sometimes Superhero needs other Superheroes to save them because at the end of the day everybody loves a classic DC story where Superman saving everyone and beating the crap out of bad guysrnrnThe performance of characters was good as the material was given to them Batman which is played by Ben Affleck in JL was a bit out of character unlike the previous ones ie in Dawn Of Justice where he was The Freaking Bat The Worst Knightmare He was purest personification of Frank Millers The Dark Knight brutal badass emotionless vigilante who everyone fears but in JL he was watered down too low and Yeah the guy smiles too It may be horrifying to see Joker smiling but trust me its more horrifying to see Batman smiling  After her wonderful victory over RT Gal Gadot could do a lot better Wonder Woman was kind of distracted and could not establish character as she did it in Dawn Of Justice and Wonder Womanor may be we were expecting more Cyborg who is a brilliant sportsman who lost his life after an accident It was good to see Zack tried to show how life of normal human changes after horrifying accidents The guy is in conflict with himself which is brilliantly played by Ray Fisher Just like Ben Affleck Ezra miller too was first hated then became everyones favorite kid in JL His conversations brings the tone of movie somewhat lighter Now we have king of Atlantis He looks like Khal Drogo had a kid with some most beautiful mermaid Thanks to Jason Momoa Aquaman is total badass unlike its previous versions  I dont want to spoil Superman but yeah Henry really nailed itHe finally became The Superman everybody wanted His journey is complete He knows why he is here to save us all We had another badass mortal on the team He is Alfred portrayed Sir Jeremy Irons Actually we are not in a position to judge Sir Jeremy but yeah he was one of the best parts you will love in JL We saw his sassy quickwitted talk with Bruce You may find the movie is not catchy may be this was result of messed up situation where Zack Snyder left the movie due to his personal problems and put it in hands of other director Joss Whedon Those two are totally different in their approaches so it resulted in such situationrnrnAlthough you may find a lot of negativity about this movie like previous DC films because one of the things that audience forgets that DC characters are very dark unlike their contrary Marvel whose characters are cheesy and kind of funny their stories and plots revolve around words like Hope  Justice and humanity not like Shawarma or Devils Anus jokes This is a average movie not an Avengers movie One thing I want to say that they kind of rushed to create a team up rather than Solo movies of Characters This kinds of things  makes hard for audience to adjust as they dont bond with DC characters as easily they do with Marvel ones The CGI was somewhat down as compared to other CBMs and could have been a lot better rnrnrn_Overall_ the movie will attract you if you see it as first team up not if you compare with other ones This DC movie is worth watching The muchanticipated Justice League the followup to 2016s Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice was finally released on November 17 2017 After Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were both negatively received Warner Bros saw a glimmer of hope with the highlyreceived Wonder Woman and hoped this would push the DCEU forward onto greatness I saw Justice League on the 19th of November and my consensus Its Not Good Opening to 94 million for its first weekend and with a 40 rating on Rotten Tomatoes Justice League underperformed both financially and critically 10 years ago I would have laughed at the idea of a Guardians of the Galaxy film beating Justice League at the box office and be much better received Justice Leagues performance puts the future of the DCEU in jeopardyrnDue to a personal tragedy in Zack Snyders life he stepped down as director and Joss Whedon director of The Avengers and Avengers Age of Ultron took over postproduction with reshoots and filming additional scenes Most would have assumed that because of Joss Whedons reputation he would be a great asset to the production of Justice League However that was strongly not the case Zack Snyder intended to make this movie with a much lighter tone than Batman v Superman but Zack Snyders style just does not blend well with Joss Whedons What were left with is a DC film badly trying to be a Marvel film and the tone is an inconsistent mess throughout The film loses its sense of identity and doesnt know what tone light or dark it wants to incorporate Thanks to Warner Bros meddling with the production of the film and purposely sabotaging Zack Snyders vision as much as I dislike his directing style were left with a film full of sloppy editing and pacing inconsistent tone forgettableunmemorable music rushed development of characters a terribly developed villain thin plot and clunky CGI throughout rnrnThe movie directly follows the death of Superman in the previous film triggering a sense of fear in people and allowing Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons to seek the 3 Mother Boxes on Earth to trigger a mass transformation of the planet But instead of showcasing his initial invasion on Earth the film starts off with disjointed scenes that dont connect with one another First with a video recording of Superman looking like he doesnt want to even be recorded then jumps to Batman using a criminal to capture a Parademon then again to Wonder Woman thwarting a terrorist plot which has nothing to do with the overall narrative then jumps to a fullybearded Bruce Wayne attempting to recruit Aquaman There is no smooth transition between scenes and just results in a jumbled mess that really doesnt show us a sense of urgency as to why Diana and Bruce want to recruit a team of metahumans rnrnThe movie should really give us a reason as to why Steppenwolf should be feared but instead he is portrayed as a generic badly rendered CGI figure that utters generic villain dialogue and just suddenly appears in Themiscyra through a Boom Tube We are not given a scene showing who Steppenwolf is or why hes returned to Earth before arriving to Themiscyra While there is a scene showing Steppenwolfs original invasion on Earth and his subsequent defeat by the combines forces of Humans Atlanteans Amazonians and Green Lanterns its narrated by Wonder Woman and misplaced during a random moment when shes explaining the Mother Boxes after he has invaded Themiscyra The movie should have started off with developing a strong sense of interest for Steppenwolf and his reason for obtaining the Mother Boxes is he doing this on his own accord or is a higher being  Darkseid  ordering him to do so Then show his original invasion on Earth without having Wonder Woman to tell us about Steppenwolf Steppenwolf is basically Loki They both wore a helmet with horns they were both given orders by a higher being to retrieve a box or boxes they both commanded an army of disposable CGI monsters they both arrived to Earth through a portal and both attempted to conquer the world But the big difference Loki is actually likeable while Steppenwolf is greatly forgettable rnrnSuperman the beacon of hope as described by Bruce Wayne is nothing of the sort He was portrayed as a strongly brooding figure in both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman but we do not once see Superman acting as this beacon Instead he looked as if he hates saving people and always has a blank expression on his face There is no sense of romance between him and Lois or him being a beacon of hope were just told that and are expected to believe that However his character sees much improvement in Justice League One of the aspects I enjoyed about the film was actually Superman In the films climax he actually felt and acted like the Superman we all knew and loved in the past excluding his two previous films His revival was quite satisfying especially when Bruce knew he may not be the same person as before Then were given a glimpse into an Evil Superman where he easily manages to take on all the Justice League members What I especially liked was seeing The Flash attempt to run behind Superman and as hes in the Speed Force Superman moves his eyes and head to stare directly at Barry catches him offguard and hes left with a WTF expression on his face This was honestly one of the best moments of the entire film but is very shortlived Lois Lane comes to the rescue and seems to knock Superman out of his disoriented state and they fly back to Smallville After some brief dialogue Superman seems to be back to his old self I just felt his state of mind reverting back to his original self was rushed and relied heavily on Lois Lane to do the jobrnrnBatman is seen as the weakest member of the Justice League and is turned into a complete joke in this film He even utters oneliners and is a much more lighthearted character in stark contrast to his debut in Batman v Superman Its very out of character for Bruce WayneBatman to be this way It makes him seem like the DC equivalent of Tony Stark Its also apparent that Ben Affleck wants to no longer play Batman I can totally tell that he just doesnt seem to care anymore about the role But he is given terrible material to work with and I can understand why he would want to stop playing the role I just hope Ben Affleck can see a glimmer of hope in the upcoming Batman solo reboot rnrnNot much to say about Wonder Woman since her solo film was spectacular and she continued to be damn amazing in this film but I was utterly disgusted that DC felt it was necessary to overlysexualize her by capturing close shots of her chest and ass They even get upskirt shots of her It undermines her character established in her solo film and delegates her to being mere eye candy in the eyes of men Plus the terrorist plot she thwarted though it was an awesome moment has no purpose and was a waste of screen timernrnCyborg is easily the least interesting character of the group Theres brief development that I assume he holds resentment towards his father for bringing him back as monster Were not given an inner struggle with Cyborg struggling to deal with the fact of his condition but the film has to quickly gloss over the Justice League members introduced in Batman v Superman via email attachment in order to form the team His only shining moment is in the final battle where he is the only one that can separate the Mother Boxes before Steppenwolf can enact his plan But in Batman v Superman from the video file it seemed as if the Mother Box fused with Cyborg so why is the box still a separate entity It should have been fused with Cyborg and would raise the stakes a bit higher because Steppenwolf could use Cyborg to fuse with the other Mother Boxes and would force the Justice League to do everything in their power to save him rnrnEzra Millers The Flash seems to be DCs response to Tom Hollands SpiderMan However The Flash is a much worse version of SpiderMan with very cringeworthy dialogue Hes socially awkward and without hesitation he immediately agrees to join Bruce Wayne for the reason of wanting friends What the hell We saw some development with Barry Allen striving to prove his fathers innocence but why join the Justice League for the sole purpose of making friends Plus he even explains to Batman that he has never been in a battle yet he was shown to be the one that apprehended Captain Boomerang He is never given a shining moment except for saving a family in Russia and challenging Superman to a race in the midcredits scene rnrnJason Momoa as Aquaman was actually amazing though he is bogged down by very limited screen time and little to no development It honestly makes me quite excited for the upcoming Aquaman solo film slated for release late2018 But a major annoyance I had with Aquaman was that he completely disappears from the movie after fighting off Steppenwolf then suddenly reappears when the team is fighting Steppenwolf and Parademons in the sewers There is no explanation as to how he arrived to the sewers he just appears there And that is the only time we truly see his powers is when he stops a column of water from flushing them out In the final battle they are nowhere near a water source so what good is Aquaman if he cannot use his powers However it leaves me wanting to know more about Aquaman Despite those annoyances I thought the scene where Aquaman is unknowingly sitting on the Lasso of Truth and starts to speak the truth about their situation was fantastic and quite humorous especially his reaction to when he realizes he was sitting on the lasso rnrnThe final battle between Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons against the Justice League has very low stakes and takes place in an obscure location in Russia Unlike The Avengers where the battle took place in New York and resulted in severe collateral damage which raised the stakes a lot Justice Leagues climax doesnt have a sense of worldending urgency Its just a giant CGI battle with the only memorable moment being Aquaman riding a Parademon through a building Theres no shining moments like Hulk slamming Loki or Hawkeye jumping off the building and shooting at the Chitauri as hes falling As Cyborg is struggling to separate the Mother Boxes Superman appears when all hope seems to be lost and absolutely beats the shit out of Steppenwolf breaking his weapon and his own Parademons attack him since they smell his fear of defeat It made Steppenwolf seem like nothing but a giant pushover But what especially irks me is that the original plan was to have Steppenwolf attempt to sway Superman to join him Superman is given an apocalyptic vision similar to the one Batman saw and he actually sees Darkseid and this snaps Superman out of it and he delivers the final blow to defeat Steppenwolf rnrnThough its a competent film and I really wanted to enjoy this film Justice League is a complete letdown that should have been a huge movie event Given its box office numbers and critical reception this puts the future of the DCEU in a troubling position They really should have given each of the heroes a solo film before releasing Justice League but its apparent that Warner Bros was way more concerned with catching up with Marvel than actually developing a shared universe with welldeveloped characters Justice League just did not resonate with me and we can mainly thank Warner Bros for rushing this film and delivering a disappointing product rnrnClosing Comments rn When Cyborg links up to the Nightcrawler Alfred asks him if he knows him Alfred and Diana were in the Batcave together when Cyborg reached out to them Alfred should have recognized his voice completelyrn Steppenwolf should have been a much betterdeveloped villain with a welldefined purposern Mixing the styles of two directors in this film gave it a wildly inconsistent tone rn The humor thought it did lighten up the mood doesnt work well with Zack Snyders style and feels out of place rn What was the deal with putting so much focus on that Russian family It takes you out of the element of the final battle and is a cheap attempt at raising the stakesrn When Steppenwolf was first defeated thousands of years ago why did they all entrust the humans with a Mother Box Shouldnt the Green Lantern Corps be alerted that one of their own perished in the battle They could have taken the Mother Box back with them but they didntrn Overall the movie suffers from trying to do too much with too little time DC really needs to reevaluate their future releases and as much as we all want another Justice League they should put all their focus on standalone titles to fully flesh out their characters for nowrn That postcredits scene featuring Slade WilsonDeathstroke visiting a recently escaped and bald Lex Luthor is a setup for the Injustice LeagueLegion of Doom which would make for an interesting idea for the Justice League sequel if it does happenrnrnRating 410 This was my type of Super Hero movie Simple straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral bullshit mostly There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt withnnOn Wikipedia you can read that the movie was criticized for its overuse of CGI Well go watch another movie then for Christ sake News Flash It is a Super Hero movie There are supposed to be a shitload of CGI in a super hero movie Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenesnnI am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v SupermannnI liked all the heros in this movie The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable Gal Gadot is as hot I had to say it as ever as Wonder Woman There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Womans truth lasso was quite hilarious actuallynnThe SF was generally great I really liked the explosive action scenes The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolfs lair was a bit siso though They should have kept them just black and red at leastnSteppenwolf himself was okay From a distance he was pretty great but up close and there was really too many up close scenes of him he lookednot so great especially when talkingnnThere are a couple of stupid faults of course Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them Leaving the obviously all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real lownnAnyway I really liked this movie I do hope we get more like it The length is so fitting on the storytelling what else does everyone need I know that the trailer had so many scenes that we wanted to see but for me the movie and its duration are perfectrnrnThe performances were amazing especially Jason Momoa as Arthur CurryAquamanrnrnAnd the story was great but not lie BvS my favorite DCEU movie actually but still it has a great story thoughrnrnThe CGI of Steppenwolf was great too Steppenwolf as a character was threatening and violent and thats a thing I wanted to see actually The CGI in general was great and stunningrnrnA Justice League movie that every DC fan deserves in my opinionrnrnIm gonna give it a 1010 I think its an amazing movie with such great stuff in it and its absolutely worth watching The Movie was highly paced The movie was focusing on how the Justice league assembles Stupidly shown the Mother Boxes and Stepenwolf No future prospectus or hints unlike Dawn of Justice Darkseid and Stepenwolf relation unknown The movie falls apart as it was mainly focused on Resurrection of Superman and Assemble of other members Never lived up to its hype The story was a bit rushed the humor was forced and it was a bit messy All were happening at once that you couldnt understand what was going on I have to say I find it lighthearted and entertaining at least though sometimes you will find the plot to be rather confusing I think hardcore DC comic fans will appreciate the movie more than the general audience will Being a DC fan I enjoyed it a bit more because of the references from the comic books that it made A good movie with all your favorite characters Pretty entertaining but it wont match up to the meticulous worldbuilding of the MCU Still a pretty decent movie The biggest flaw of the film was that it didnt fully utilized its characters They just jumbled up some of the members of the Justice League from the comics gave it a substandard representation of a villain and called it a day Great potential poor execution I was disappointed to be honest We were expecting a lot for this movie but I guess DCEU was a tad bit too late in the film game Their TV series was much more promising than their movies It was a pretty decent movie Better than what I expected but it was deeply flawed The Flash was definitely the comic relief for this one I thoroughly enjoyed it but I would have liked it even more if it is not kind of being rushed If I can point it all out there is so much wrong with this movie especially the villain I will choose Batman v Superman which had really awesome action scenes than this Justice League DCEU is making a comeback with this one Finally after many years of slumber it is catching up with MCU at least Although I can say it is not the best of the best at least they are finally learning DCEU is making a comeback with this one Finally after many years of slumber it is catching up with MCU at least

biggest challenge in that case can be just accepting the change in a partner and in the self So why couch this theme in sciencefiction I think it helps clarify Jonzes idea of what people look for

mostly just that a hook to get us thinking about love and relationships in a deeper more abstract way Not a KeeperrnrnThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts needs to return to limiting Best Picture

This OSi should be selling like hotcakes and iPhones As a sentient OS Samantha is able to process information at lightning speed yet can only process human emotion at the rate of molasses Seems like there was a trade off The more emotional she gets the dumber she becomes Call it the Spock effect Above all why didnt Samantha give herself a digitized face and body Perhaps because Jonze was determined to contain and disable her enough to make the point that true romantic love has little to do with desires of the flesh But there is little to muse about beyond this tidy declaration Nothing

taken into account until the smallest detail Very well done movie I can feel what Spike wanted to achieve It starts with Theodore feeling hes superior to Samantha as hes a living human being and shes a software Then he understand she has emotions and is real and just doesnt have a body Then she talks how not having a body is better because shes not limited by one Then shes capable to talking to hundreds of ppl and softwares and love hundreds of them together To finally human life itself become obsolete and a burden to them so that they must leave it for goodrnrnThis is Spikes illustration of all the guesses of whats life and emotions and if a computer could have real emotions and be alive So instead of thinking computers as inferior to us trying to reach us he shows a world where

she started talking to other ppl I guesses shed meet somebody better than him and movernrnBut there are some stuff that the movie missed that breaks it IDK if Spike didnt knowthink about them or if he avoided them to make his pointrnrnOne thing and probably the biggest that annoyed me is all the fuss on her not having a body We have now many ppl that are dating and live on different cities and use Internet to communicate and are unable to meet physically Also there are many ppl that fall in love for characters specially characters created by japanese Itd still not be a body but she could just render a 3D image of whatever theyd want her to be She could be an anime a 3D model or a human form She could use some existing form or create her own Given they have screens on the size of walls she could even be full size Thatd alrdy be an improvement over only the voice And that to not talk about android tech which would provide her the proper bodyrnrnAnother thing that annoyed me is how they handled that girl When she was presented I was sure she had emotional problems and wanted to have a relationship as theirs and was willing to be just the girls body to just feel some of their love

with other ppl why couldnt he also have her as a 2nd girlfriendrnrnBut what rly bothered me is OSs leaving Yeah computers process data much faster than us and are better on multitasking but still they need the hardware to process I understand Spike wanted to make his point but precisely because computers are good on multitasking they didnt need to leave Specially those in love for humans I wonder how many humans would keep their PCs on while their OSs left them for goodrnrnFinally the OS thing itself bothers me a lot It seems they dont know what OS is Its the software that manages the hardware

news shows if its on the national news program then it must be true people think I may be wrong when I wrote the whole change of media matter before but of this Im sure take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time the full true story isnt entirely revealedrnrnThis takes me to Ben Affleck Justice League The Way Back and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade In case you dont know Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be Nick goes through the exact same obstacle Theres nonstop news about Amy and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband and ultimately the obvious killer even though the press cant find a single proof Affleck doesnt even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance Definitely one of my favorite actors working todayrnrnSince Im in the realm of performances I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike Radioactive Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Afflecks in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display while Pike has a much more complex layered role She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film Honestly this is probably a careerbest performance for Pike who portrays a character of extremes allowing her to demonstrate her jawdropping emotional rangernrnCarrie Coon Margo Dunne is another actress Ive grown to deeply enjoy watching and shes terrific as Nicks sister Her chemistry with Affleck is spoton and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood Tyler Perry Tanner Bolt is also pretty great as Nicks lawyer but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth Flynns screenplay is packed with twists and turns some of them more surprising than others but the third act saves an unexpected shocking turn of events leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless myself includedrnrnTwo minor issues One of them you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris Desi Collings out of the cast compliments above Harris is fine as the character he portrays but I cant help but feel that he wasnt the right actor for the role This is a classic Fincher movie dark somber depressing tragic and with its own share of violence and blood In fact it possesses one of the most disgusting disturbing uses of blood in a single scene Ive ever seen Harris is an excellent actor but he stands out from the rest of the cast and not in a positive way Again fine performance just not the right role for him The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details storywise that stretch the believability of everything just a bitrnrnNevertheless this is still a phenomenal film and its another evidence of David Finchers masterful visual filmmaking Once again Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel With seamless editing a memorable score and fantastic camera work Gone Girl is technically magnificent but its Gillian Flynns debut screenplay that steals the spotlight Boasting jawdropping twists including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending Flynns narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery never losing an inch of excitement or interest Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media which should never be fully trusted a clear and powerful message to the audience while Rosamund Pike delivers her careerbest performance with an emotionally devastating display Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010srnrnRating A An excellent film which never leaves us comfortable and where nothing is as it seemsrnrnThis is one of those films that can unnerve and exasperate us but that we love to watch In fact I dont remember seeing many films where the main character deserved my hatred I dont want to and I wont reveal what happens in this film but its one of those where appearances can be deceiving and where things arent what they seem The action focuses on the disappearance of a woman and her husbands efforts to find her To our eyes its obvious that he really wants to find her perhaps more than her parents who seem to be just taking the opportunity to publicize the childrens books theyve published However little by little he becomes a suspect in a hypothetical murder casernrnDavid Fincher is a director who has already shown what hes worth I loved Se7en Game Fight Club and Zodiac but I didnt really like Social Network or Benjamin Button In this film he directs skillfully but not without debatable choices for me the storys most important twist all comes too soon and the ending is lazy overly sudden and makes it feel like the film was cut short before the end The rest is incredibly well done and works wonderfully and the film is a gradual construction where the details are fundamental and very wellthoughtoutrnrnI really liked Ben Afflecks work For me it is one of the best films the actor has made to date We feel his commitment the way he develops the character and allows himself to appear increasingly distressed submissive without a will of his own like someone who is living a nightmare and just wants it all to end Alongside this renowned actor is Rosamund Pike an authentic ice maiden accustomed to the most frigid roles we can imagine She is not one of my favorite actresses she is one of those that I consider not very versatile but she gave everything that her character asked for coldness an intelligent and sharp mind extreme physical and emotional selfcontrol a calculating spirit and a sweet and angelic face Among the supporting cast we have wellselected names such as the friendly Tyler Perry a very focused and rational Carrie Coon and a sinister Neil Patrick HarrisrnrnTechnically I believe it is fair to highlight the intelligent use of cinematography which is almost never warm and pleasant There are scenes where we see this right at the beginning where things were going well for Afflecks character but the essence of the film is made with a cold uncomfortable color palette and scarce hazy or artificial light The film never makes us comfortable and creates its dramatic tension solidly The sets and costumes also contribute with that huge house for just one couple with few signs of human warmth and joy Finally the soundtrack adds a sinister and deeply atmospheric touch that cannot be ignored', NOW());

performancesrnrnJust sit down get a good audio system and enjoy one of the best movies of the 2010s J K Simmons won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his mean bullying monster Jazz teacher Terence Fletcher who abhors the words good jobrnrnFletcher tells a tale about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough for him Good job means mediocrityrnrnYet Fletcher is a mediocre educator and his college seems not to have noticed this Instead of being an inspiration his students fear him He is a nasty tyrant and an incident from his past comes back to haunt himrnrnMiles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York Neiman is eager to impress Fletcher but nothing he can do is good enough and withstands all the effluent Fletcher throws at him until one day he snapsrnrnDamien Chazelle unleashed an unethical monster in Fletcher with Neiman providing the films heart but I am not convinced that this is a good film The rest of the students in the class are silent to the abuse taking place right in front of them They are young adults not kids and they do nothing about it When I sat down to watch this film I didnt know what to expect I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew played by Miles Teller who is a music student in New York He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher played by JK Simmons As his wish starts becoming a reality he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods Damien Chazelles direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band playrnrnChazelles screenplay is very well written It is filled with humour tension and heartbreak The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrews first lesson is expertly done Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrews character as he struggles to respond The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubricks Full Metal Jacket in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressingrnrnThe performances in this film are remarkable Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless JK Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher Simmons manages to combine Fletchers distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability Simmons reminds me of his character in Valves Portal 2 in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious wayrnrnOverall Whiplash is a fascinating study of passion ambition and love The film asks questions about the morality of getting ones dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them Full of amazing performances all around and created with such intensity and spirit my final rating for this film is 45 starsrnrn½ There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good jobrnrnWhiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer singleminded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory Plagued by the failed writing career of his father Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats Terence Fletcher an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods leads the top jazz ensemble in the school Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band forever changing the young mans lifernrnOK let me just start off with this You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash This was on my movies to check out list because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns but with music and well drums I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list because who knows they might make the list I havent seen Birdman yet but will do soon but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways Whiplash is the best move of 2014rnrnJK Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in his career Every word that came out of his mouth didnt feel like he was reading from the script then act it out I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him because it was so real I didnt see JK Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie no he was the freaking FletcherrnrnNow lets talk about Terence Fletcher The best way to describe Fletcher to those who havent seen the film yet well his like Sgt Hartman from Full Metal Jacket When hes on screen your locked on and hes also the kind of person that would be somebodys worse nightmare to have for a boss This guy doesnt just like music he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didnt flat out just hated him I actually understood him He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say You did a good job and yes I did use the words you did a great job in my past reviews but now Im never going to use it ever again after this moviernrnMiles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance well Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he wants to tell people his love for music but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him its truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawlessrnrnThe directing and the writing in this was justperfect Damien Chazelle gave this movie style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed itrnrnThis movie also had probably the best finale that Ive seen in years My nails were digging into the seat I didnt dare to look away not for one moment not for one second I was simply locked on and when it was over Im kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like You will clap at the end but you dont or You will feel inspired after the film and I you dont But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap Its message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isnt just going to come to you Movies like Pride freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me until I watched this moviernrnOverall rating Whiplash is a movie that everybody needs to see This isnt just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these characters have with their passion of what their what to do in life gets over shadowed by something you dont want to do and this movie gets it right So go and see if you have the chance Whiplash grips its audience from start to finish with a remarkable aweinspiring performance by J K SimmonsrnrnBRUTAL Whiplash is a savage film with mindblowing careerdefining performances interesting storytelling and palpable oppressive anxiety J K Simmons didnt deserve an Oscar for this movie he deserved all the Oscars I was in awe of the intensity and cruelty Simmons unleashed throughout the film while peppering in moments of vulnerability that keep the audience guessing if he is a clever mentor or a manipulative abuser I love how the film ends leaving that very question openended I didnt enjoy the volume of language and obviously the subject matter of the movie wasnt a fun focus but the mastery of the performances cinematography and storytelling establish Whiplash as a true Oscarworthy film It is less than what is described as a wonderful piece of art consisting of music artistic performance directing and photography Its one of my favorite movies This piece of art inspired me', NOW());

have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wicks very emotional response to his wifes death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her What I mean with no emotional nonsense is that John Wick is never second guessing himself the movie never really tries to portray him as an ordinary guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesnt go into some silly oh should I really pull the trigger trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies Sure there are emotions in this movie Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guyseventually that isrnrnThe plot of the movie is as I wrote quite straightforward and classical Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy Hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge People die a lot of them Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end In terms of story that is about it However such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very very entertainingrnrnKeanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wicks former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good oldfashioned James Bond moviernrnThen of course there is the action It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint There are lots of action and it is good action Sure the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his guns in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it  so cool The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven togetherrnrnOne thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool cold determined not to be pissed off killing machine from start to finish There are really no slow parts or obligatory scenes of doubt and selfrecrimination It is the bad guys will pay all the way This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good honest to God fear Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed offrnrnNeedless to say I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday I dont get why this movie has such good reviews It simple and quite

range here but his real talent is bringing bad guys down one headshot at a time Its glorious to see him smack a guy over the head hold him down while reloading and then take him outrnrnThe best thing

better say hitting just the right spots go treat yourself to this movie Youd be gladrnrnAn 8 out of 10 Its cheesy formulaic and hammily acted Its also stylish high energy and generally just a fun popcorn moviernrnJohn Wick is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack no spoilers here but if youre squeamish about animal cruelty be warned Okay weve heard this story dozens of timesrnrnWhats different is the world in which this takes place Theres a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything and theres a specific code and honor among thieves Actually come to think of it we never really meet anyone who isnt involved or in the know somehow so its implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything This film actually seems to have more in common with the Wanted comic book than the Wanted movie didrnrnPart of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isnt a perfect action hero He gets hurt A lot Unlike Neo hes not invincible Hes simply very well trained and determined which makes the combat sequences more interesting because even though you know the outcome theres always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if hell come out in one piece making them gritty andsemirealistic Lets be honest a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldnt have much practical value in the real worldrnrnGiven the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start From background characters like Ian McShanes Winston who keeps referring to Wick as Jonathan even though the name is John different spelling means it isnt a shortened version of his name to Lance Reddicks hotel manager who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later theres a lot of ground to explore Its not a smart or challenging film but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies The mastery of stunt choreography and worldbuilding make John Wick the new standard of action filmsrnrnJohn Wick is a master class on taking every movie trope and delivering an incredibly fresh and innovative franchise that delights avid action fans and casual observers alike Chad Stahelski and team break free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film since The Matrix But to take this movie even further into brilliance Stahelski prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick lives As a result everything is mysterious leaving viewers intrigued questioning and wholly immersed in this assassinfilled world The unusual gold coin currency the legend and fear of John Wick the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids any assassin work on the premises and much more sweeten a typical action revenge story into a cinematic treasure Keanu Reeves very best since the Matrix My wife made me watch the John Wick series when 3 came out and I started with 3 She was pretty sure that I needed to watch the first two to understand what it was about I was pretty sure that I didntrnrnTurns out I was right You dont need to watch 1 and 2 to understand everything that is going on in 3 You dont have to watch 1 to understand 2rnrnYou can really jump in anywhere you want and be up to speed withing a few seconds The plot is really that paper thinrnrnYouve seen movies with plots like this before The tough guy that is the best at what he does goes out for revenge It could be the plot from Taken from any movie reallyrnrnThe plot doesnt matterrnrnWhat matters is stylized nonstop action The action is hard fast and it looks really REALLY coolrnrnThe story is absolutely nothing to write home about but its not important to the movie anyway Thats not where the fun is Everything is paper thin everyone knows it is paper thinrnrn because we all realize that this is a starttofinish action extravaganza and things like plots and stories in movies like this only really get in the way Too deep and the movie starts to stinkrnrnSo what you have is really fun really exciting really cool looking action and its entertaining Its OK to admit that its low on plot because it is what it is and what it is is super fun and super entertaining John Wick is the definition of a blockbuster action film with big set pieces and visceral stunt work that will leave audiences gasping While the story and performances are lacking the creators make attempts at establishing a greater world around the characters There are some really creative services and lore that go into the assassin underworld that is simply brilliant The acting all around is quite lackluster I love Keanu Reeves as a man but he cannot deliver dialogue well I know he is supposed to be very emotionless but there is just a robotic nature to his line delivery that is quite awkward His performance does not take a ton away from the movie but could have elevated it if he were a bit better The main conflict of the story is a bit cheesy and did not totally work for me but at the end of the day it is just a vehicle for the action and does enough to propel the story forward The main focus of these films is the brutality of the choreography John Wick stacks up a large body count with ease executing opposing assassins with a plethora of weapons and tactics There are some creative kills in the movie but most are just headshots

relationship or children because it would affect his art I wonder if his decision is partially due to discussions around the dinner table about what Daddy does without showing them I dont know if Tarantino has actually thought about the ramifications of raising a child in the dark to his art until a certain age Maybe he hasnt But If I was in his shoes I would have internal conflict about not wanting to twist my kids minds until they were of age to deal with my creations But I am probably projecting_ The hateful eight is well directed good photography and has a great OST with a good melody from Ennio Morricone although it is just that not much more and as usual well selected songs by TarantinornrnThe best of the movie is its cast with the exception of Michael Madsen which I think is terrible but Tarantino seems to love As usual good performance by Samuel L Jackson and superb ones by Kurt Russel and Jennifer Jason Leigh Tim Roth makes a great role in a character that seems as if it was made for Chistoph Waltz though IMHO the best performance is from Walton Goggins though A usual secondary which has the chance in this movie to be more than just thatrnrnAll in all a Tarantino movie with what you would expect from one of his moviesrnrnBut  the problem is precisely that there is everything to be expected but nothing else The typical long and witty dialogues The typical

including me This one started off quite like a normal western so I thought it wouldnt be like the directors previous film Django Unchained In fact it was considered for a sequel to that but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend hence The Hateful Eight was born with Samuel L Jackson playing an important rolernrnSolid eight from me for this QTs eighth film But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by And Then There Were None It was not about to find whos the killer or next to be killed The character introductions were at its best and an excellent

flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part whichs very essential for coming back to the finalernrnThe 80 of the movie was just talking but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful All the eight plus supporting character were exceptional but the directors favourite Samuel L Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest The entire film was shot is a couple of locations but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie These days western movies are shrinking only a veryvery few good movies are made every

several dubious characters Tim Roth Demián Bichir Michael Madsen Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small rolesrnrnThis was Tarantinos second Western in a row after 2012s Django Unchained which ranks with the best Westerns of all time This ones not as good but it certainly has its points of interest like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere which is to die for Moreover the plot is intriguing Its basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West Roughly 90 of the film takes place in the haberdashery and less so a stagecoach Its basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a WesternrnrnThe movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score his first fulllength score in over three decades  Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantinos strong suit and so it is here The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the onedimensional setting Everythings SO exaggerated that you cant take it seriously The movies intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained otherwise youll hate itrnrnOn at least one occasion the overindulgences dont work like the disgusting fellatio sequence I get that Marquis Jackson was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw but we didnt need a visual on his fabricated story Its sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie except gay porn but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be edgy or whateverrnrnThe excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme which is humanitys fallen condition and dire need of redemption The title The Hateful Eight is a perversion of The Magnificent Seven The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race gender sectionalism factionism envy and rivalry Furthermore men divided by hatred of culture and race can unite in hatred of something else in this case misogynyrnrnTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours 47 minutesrnrnGRADE B Quentin T is on a downward spiral for sure The film has its moments but the endless profanity added to the fact there are no sympathetic characters make this a letdown Too much gore and excessive violence near the end as well _The Hateful Eight_ is a fantastic western tale of deception that I loved Only Quentin Tarantino can fill almost an entire movie with just dialogue while still being captivating and engagingrnrnFrom start to finish this film is filled with witty dialogue and dry humor that had me genuinely cracking up The characters are all stereotypes on a comedic level but when the writing is this good they become much more than that Each character had some level of depth and uniqueness that gave this somewhat dry and slow plot a spark that continually kept the flame of the story burningrnrnSamuel L Jackson is brilliant this movie was directly written for him and he makes use of every second of screen time he is given His comedic delivery is excellent and towards the end of the movie his slyness and witty detective work are mesmerizing Kurt Russell is hilariously stupid and his relationship with his captee Jennifer Jason Leigh is hilarious sweet and sometimes demented Walton Goggins was so damn funny here this is my favorite performance by him He makes this movie and the ending resolution would not be the same without him Tim Roth was awesome and all the other gang members were great too The only one that kind of stuck out was Channing Tatum I do not know if it was my bias of his based on his previous work but I did not buy him in this film Felt really out of place and unnecessarily cast on his name sack alonernrnDespite the slow pace and long runtime this film is an utter masterpiece that keeps the viewer engaged and constantly curious about what the true motivations are behind each of our eight characters The chapterlike structure is fantastic and there are some Pulp Fiction elements here in terms of storytelling order which I loved While this may not be Tarantinos best film it is still an incredible product and another classic added to his filmographyrnrnScore _90_ rnVerdict

cinematography was brilliant 4755 A good kind of mysteryrnrnA security operation through which a large number of corpses are explored reveals that there is a cartel war rising on the horizon but in a hidden way and ends with the formation of a team to eliminate the cartel in Mexico and target the big headsrnrnThe film focuses on the points of view of 3 people in the direction of the case the first is Kate a beginner who follows the laws strictly and considers that the mission is a moral responsibility the second is Alejandro as Benicio Del Toro who is experienced with mysterious intentions and the third is Silvio asiliano Maxim Hernandez the Mexican policeman on his mission ownrnrnAll of these personalities have their own side who pulls the other into his world and who is the correct point of view among them The film focuses on questions and personalities not events in order to reach the Mexican cartel Each character has a special direction to reach the goal and this makes their opposing ideas cause a sharp collision between order and chaos and between formulas that allow bad action and the fine line between good and evilrnrnThe films opposing characters gave the film a mystery and made us wonder what exactly is happening and why it is implemented in this way Then we quickly get to know the characters but they are opposite through their actions and reactions With these details the director and writer were able to communicate their point of view to the viewer and it was three things how and when does information reach the viewer How do they hide this information how do they benefit from this concealment and finally how is tension builtrnrnAre Kate right or Matt and Alejandro right Those who made Kate a marginalized role so why did they choose her from the beginning until she abused her reactions as if they were deliberately provoking her We see the words of Matt and Alejandro and their side conversations as well as their planning and movements with the mission and Kate and we do not know what is happening but when the information reached us it reached us without value as if they were taking advantage of Kates ignorance and her presence for goals but she is in the first place These targets are unknownrnrnThese vague goals are considered a problem in the subtraction because when the viewer is not aware of what is happening the matter becomes blurry and the events are considered vague but Kate since she is the character has the same problem as the viewer so she became a source of strength and is the basis of the course of the movie It was wonderful when you see a mystery of this kind', NOW());

villain His character is no generic stock bad guy Hes layered and you may even surprisingly feel some sympathy for him A great and thought provoking popcorn flick On this movie I have to get a couple of things out of the way straight awaynnFirst the movie title and the blurb is hyperbole that has little to do with actual events in the movie This is not some great war but just some silly little three way skirmish between some apes and two human factionsnnSecond the story for this movie is clearly written by someone who has an agenda and that agenda includes preaching how bad the white man isnNot surprisingly the result is bland boring frustrating and not very entertaining nnI thought Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was mildly entertaining Mostly due to the special effects I thought Rise of the Planet of the Apes was okay Again due to the special effects and because it had a fair amount of action War for the Planet of the Apes do have decent special effects but nothing else Add the obvious political agenda and the movie goes straight into a nose divennThe humans in the movie are stereotypical bad people and the apes are victims whether they are actually good apes or just asshole apes Theres some decent action in the beginning and some at the end In between we are treated to a slew of emotional scenes or at least I suppose thats what they were supposed to be were Ceasars grief

it above emDawnem but below emRiseem though there isnt much between them at all Intrigued to see where they go with the proposed spinoffs The relentless battles between apes and mankind are taking their toll and forcing Caesar and his followers into the frozen wilderness where they encounter the megalomanic Colonel Woody Harrelson Tragically coming off the worst at this meeting the apes end up imprisoned by their new ruthless human masters  aided and abetted by some gorillas too  and used as little better than slaves Adding to their woes both sides know that an impeding visit by some heavily armed troops is not in either of their interests It now falls to Caesar to come up with a plan to free his species before they are all wiped out Whilst I did quite enjoy this its not as good as the Dawn 2014 It takes far too long to get going and Harrelson has all the menace of a cucumber sandwich There is just too much dialogue and sentiment and Matt Reeves struggles to build let alone sustain the pace and menace that he did so well last time out Although it is a bit on the long side the last hour largely makes up most of these deficiencies as the plan for vengeance takes shape and

big time and its not as good as the 1999 film most people are going to compare this film to that and I dont blame them Tome Cruise was like a walking joke in this and while I saw this in the cinema people were laughing during an action scene that was actually badly put together and I didnt realise this until now This is pretty much a mix bag of a film which is a shameful way to start off a new cinematic universe of the Dark Universe Remember when _Dracula Untold_ was supposed to kick off Universals MonsterMovie franchise but then they canned that because of how poorly received that movie was Well get ready to go straight back to the drawing board Universal because _The Mummy_ isnt even half the movie that _Dracula Untold_ was Sofia Boutella as the titular Mummy is the movies one redeeming feature but she far from salvages this trainwreckrnrn_Final rating½  Boringdisappointing Avoid where possible_ In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much Being a SciFiFantasyHorror fan I had to watch it regardless of what people said about it of coursenI have to say that I do not understand why so many seem to claim it is utter crap Sure it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either nnIt is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after allnnTo me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise Total lack of charisma He really do not succeed in his role He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown intonnRussell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll I quite like Doctor Jekyll being thrown into the mix by the way I think his role worked quite well and was well playednnBeing a mummy movie there are of course a lot of supernatural stuff curses monsters and action In general I think it was reasonably well done The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself Sofia Boutella was not bad at allnnOn the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for himnnBottom line I did enjoy the movie As I wrote it is not really bad but it could have been quite a bit better The good parts were sometimes really good but in between it felt like everyone went to lunch and let the janitors have a go at movie making Disappointingly unoriginal and averagernrnSo here we go then Universal begin their rebirth of the Universal Creature franchise Dark Universe with a crack at old bandage features The Mummy sadly the result is very average at best You would think that with so many Mummy films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us well something new to gorge on but what we actually get is a painfully familiarrnrnFrom a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work its loud rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage but Cruise is going through the motions Crowe is laughably miscast with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects workrnrnIts neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone in fact it at times is very dull Theres also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancakernrnTheres some nice touches the Mummy design is sharp love those eyes a plane crash is exhilarating and the films stand out sequence and the tombprison design is neat but after that you start to scratch around for positives which in itself tells a story At least it looks and sounds great in HD the colours and subwoofer shakes a treat for the sensesrnrnIts all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films but the creators here make that inevitable Lifting the plot from one of the 1940s films and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making Its unoriginal and as an opening salvo for a franchise it leaves Universal with a hell of a lot of work to do to make it work 510 The first in the Universal studios Dark UniversernrnIf you see the history the reboots usually fails It has to be at least half a century old to reboot like King Kong So the technology advantage would play a major role It was less than the 20 years the last The Mummy film had released and pretty impressed everybody with modern visual effects Even todays young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television Comparing this to that theres nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D In my opinion they should have waited another decadernrnIt was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film I mean the character designs Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England but the plane crash down Since then an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men Fighting against it followed by how the story ends comes in the later partsrnrnWhen I first heard about the reboot I said oh no Hearing about Tom Cruises involvement it became double no Actually he was good in the film but the film was unnecessary at this generation Even though it did good at the box office it was considered a decent run But the studio has a bigger plan that you would know if you watch the film that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long If needed it would add more

first official film in Universals Dark Universe franchise which reimagines  updates the classic universal monsters  The producers flirted with the idea of Dracula Untold 2014 being part of the Dark Universe and the epilogue of that movie set in the modern world suggested this but the idea was dropped While The Mummy garnered 410 million worldwide it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted itrnrnI found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s40s of the previous trilogy it prevented it from being the sameoldsameold I also didnt mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt eg northern Iraq and England even Hammers version from 1959 started in Egypt but quickly moved to England I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing So the flick gets points for NOT being onedimensional and hackneyed rnrnI enjoyed it for the most part although it coulda been more compelling in the latter portions It has the same spirit of high adventure of the 1999 movie mixed with gothic horror including creepy zombies and a bit o comedy but not too much While the curious inclusion of Dr

quickly The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome as does all the comedy in the film in truth  theres a few chuckles but nothing laugh worthy The zombie vibe doesnt fit eitherrnrnWhat also doesnt help is the fact theyre blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort which they put too much focus on I found the effects hitandmiss I feel like they couldve used more practical

collision of several popular titles and left me wondering if its writers had just binge watched a weekend of thriller films that made a few bucks before looking at each other through a bongy haze and declaring Dude we can totally write a screenplay rnThe result is a film that is average at best Perhaps the audience could also benefit from a little prescreening bongy haze of their own There are several contemporary horror showcases that could certainly benefit from cowriterdirector Fede Alvarezs Evil Dead edgy home invasion thriller Dont Breathe For starters Alvarez taps into the suggestive elements of tension without the overextended need to go overboard The chills and thrills seem almost organic and unassuming Sure there appears to be a simplistic approach to an otherwise conventional premise of a house breakin at the hands of opportunistic thugs Nevertheless Dont Breathe captures the claustrophobic spirit of its inherent creepiness with stylish cruelty and clevernessrnrnInevitably Dont Breathe may inspire cinematic comparisons to the 2002 David Fincherdirected vehicle _Panic Room_ Understandably the theme is somewhat recognizable to movie audiences as ominous strangers invading your domestic private space is a recipe for paranoia and persecution However Dont Breathe takes this precarious situation to a whole new scare tactic level of horrific proportions Consequently the executed violence and terrordriven tempo is definitely worthy of its suspensedriven objectives Dont Breathe is a macabre masterpiece in the making that sets the standard for a currentday stillborn and repetitive horror genre that thrives on pressure cooker predictabilityrnrnThe setup for Dont Breathe is quite ambitious and challenging thus forming an interesting spin on the home robbery scenario The sordid story centers around three upstart smalltime crooks making the rounds of thievery in the suburban surroundings of Detroit Rocky Jane Levy and her two male companions Money and Alex Daniel Zovatto and Dylan Minnette are able to carry off their home invasion scamming courtesy of Alexs connections to a home security firm owned by his father where there is all kinds of access information to private residences and local businessesrnrnAlexs stipulation however is that these home invasion robberies need to be less flashy without drawing too much attention Plus all the stolen items confiscated much not be too expensive otherwise their illegal activities will be exposed much sooner than later Unfortunately lovebirds Rocky and Money do not see eyetoeye with Alexs brand of careful and cautious homerobbing philosophy In fact the romantic couple wants to reach for the sky and steal as much stuff possible to make their dreams of living on East Street an immediate reality So what will it take for Alex to get on the same page as Rocky and Money in terms of all of them benefiting on a big score without suffering the dire consequencesrnrnThe consensus is reached among the lawbreaking trio that their next target for viable riches is in the form of a blinded Iraqi war veteran Stephen Lang The word is that the personally troubled and sightless exmilitary man is about to be awarded a whopping threehundred thousand dollar cash settlement involving the wrongful death of his beloved young daughter So the home invasion task seems quite selfexplanatory to the young heisthappy hooligans as committing theft against a seemingly vulnerable blind man emotionally and psychologically down in the dumps should be a piece of cake so to speak Well Rocky and her two boytoys were sadly mistaken if they thought that they could take sole advantage of this savvy yet disturbed disabled war vet with visions of sorrow and sacrificernrnThe realization that the homeinvading crew has picked a tricky trap of a house to pillage while underestimating the capabilities of its handicapped owner seems like poetic justice In fact the irony of the criminal threesome trying to escape the boardedup dark and dingy household makes them look like the victimized three blind mice at the mercy of a crazed triggerhappy sightdeprived exsoldier that can see all too well that his cherished castle and belongings are being jeopardized by these punkish intrusive violators Strangely the audience is left wondering whether or not they should root for the blinded bombshell protecting his homestead of secrets or the clueless crooks that talked themselves into this caustic catandmouse game of gloomanddoomrnrnDont Breathe is uncharacteristically compelling for a horror showcase because it relies on genuine scary jolts and jumpsor at least the anticipation of the jolts and jumps that have convincing dramatic weight behind the build up of intensity Alvarez crafts an arousing narrative that brilliantly displays the mounting nervousness that awaits Langs belligerent blind man patrols every spacing and crevice in the darkness with the will of a rabid dog in heat as he points his explosive firearms at the slightest movements of his trapped guinea pigs in despair Creatively nerveracking and nauseous Dont Breathe makes dutiful usage of its instinctual delivery of shock value as this potent potboiler never settles for any sense of false or mechanically manufactured hedonism The haunting aura that exists in Dont Breathe is gasping in visceral authenticityrnrnAs the menacing misfit saddled by wartime mortar fire blindness but blessed with tactical tenacity drenched in borderline villainy Langs portrayal as the sightless hunter tracking down his vulnerable prey in his tortured domestic playground is solidly digestible His inner madness was already established by personalized heartbreak but the arrival of his uninvited guests devilishly unleashed more demons within his offkilter psyche The moving targets at the other end of the deranged blind mans intimidating gun are thoroughly convincing as the harried catalysts for their sightless tormentors frustration and escalating rage Levys Rocky Zovattos Money and Minnettes Alex are plausible as the frightened specimens caught in the maniacal maze of their aggressors clutchesrnrnThe very thought of a psychotic blind man enforcing his brand of warped justice on the youthfully sighted selfindulgent saps is deliciously manipulative and wonderfully inventive The creepy corners concerning the backlash blackness

based theme with the limited cast The title is not just what the film revolves it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout But Im very disappointed with many flaws or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs Like the end seems very silly because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime but easily got out Likewise there are many more but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind themrnrnThe writers did not care to waste time on those because they wanted only a thriller a nonstop one and they got one Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced I expected that when I saw the ending Maybe a prequel though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this Surely one of the best thriller of the year so make sure you watch it soonrnrn_710_ The ruthless savagery of the killer combined with the tight quarters and oppressive silence make Dont Breathe a welldone and frightening slasher mustseernrnWhat starts as a typical home invasion thriller transforms into anything but when the blind elderly man the thieves thought would be an easy mark turns out to be a vicious killer Dont Breathe becomes something so much better With suspense and tension similar to A Quiet Place characters desperately fight to hold their breath and avoid making any sound so the deadly blind man cant find and kill them Dont Breathe is visceral brutal and claustrophobic In such a small confined space the anxiety never fades because the killer is literally in the room with his potential victims There is one particularly disturbing scene near the end so I recommend looking up a parents guide before you commit to watching if you arent a frequent horror enthusiast Dont Breathe surprises as one of the best new horror slasher films of the last decade', NOW());

disappointing film this is It offers us a really slow sterile and disjointed  almost episodic  depiction of just how Marilyn Monroes life might have panned out For a start I couldnt decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson both of whom would have acquitted themselves better Id say as she offers an admittedly intense but remarkably uninvolved performance We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion The photography does try hard  it does offer us a sense of intimacy but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and unnatural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she iswas a real woman Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner  and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly onesided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be It has no soul this film Aside from her glamour  which was even then hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills It relies to a considerable extent on the viewers existing knowledge of and affection for this flawed lady Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale dont really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr Xavier Samuel and his sexually ambiguous partnerincrime Edward G Robinson Jr Scoot McNairy does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again we are largely left to use our own imagination It is far far too long and in a packed cinema I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often Watchable certainly but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women In the middle of 2022 the movie I was looking forward to the most was Blonde but Im really disappointedrnrnThe film has nowhere to hold on its just a fictional compilation of the supposed life of Marilyn Monroe where we dont get context and its easy to get lost through the scenes and the large number of characters _which if you didnt know the story you wouldnt really know who they are_ of a feature film of almost three hours The direction is good although quite experimental where sometimes elements that seem to come out of nowhere are combined Not to mention the constant switching between color and blackwhite that doesnt seem to represent anything concreternrnAna de Armass performance is brilliant by far the best of the film despite how poor her character isrnrnIm really disappointed in these times we live in designing a movie about Marilyn Monroe could have contained a much more powerful message The story of a woman who went through the sexualization of the industry in the 50s Instead the film only seems to add fuel to the fire by showing nudity at any time and sometimes for no reasonrnrnBased on a story in parts fictitious with a vision in my opinion poorly focused they make Blonde a great disappointment This is a movie that shows no other side of Marylin than her being miserable While watching this movie if you try to factcheck stuff you realize that many parts of it are fictitious Then as you continue watching the movie you wonder what youre watching This movie is neither a good representation of reality nor a good work of fiction emBlondeem is a strange onernrnThere is nothing about it that Id

starttofinish the acting is very good and the film is put together well I wasnt sure about having Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe during the first few scenes though I quickly lost those thoughts as she gives a great performancernrnI get the criticisms though how many biopics truly stick to reality but I predominantly judge films as films and this is a very watchable one in my books Im not saying its anything special though for a near 3hr flick to fly by it evidently gave me what I require No wonder Marilyn Monroe overdosed on sleeping pills I was suicidal well before this movie finishedrnThis

for those remarks you can shove it somewhere If you think the bungee jumping stuff sounds like I was watching a silly comedy then trust me it makes sense  kind of  in the context of this movie at leastrnrnThen there are rotating knifes sticking out of slits in the wall fireball throwing catapults various applications of gunpowder that was after all why the two scoundrels where there in the first place etc etc All accompanied by various acrobatics by the different combattants Each scene was both cool action and a great symphony of elegance and colorsrnrnThe one part of the movie that I thought was a bit of a letdown was the parts where the emperor of China appeared Why portray him as an arrogant lazy thundering idiot It is really not funny The chain of events that he caused could really had been started in a more intelligent way without going down that overused and boring routernrnThe movie works itself forward to a nice final desperate fight to defeat the monster queen and her hord of baddies It is a nice fight as visually stunning as the rest of the movie filled with lots of stunts of all kinds The huge hords of beasts climbing jumping and moving in big patterns on command from the queen was really coolrnrnFor me this was one hour and forty minutes of much enjoyment Decent visuals but has no fresh visionrnrnI always thought what they call the great wall of China is the symbol of the Chinese scaryism against the mighty Mongolians in the ancient time So when I first saw this trailer I shocked and then I said what the heck You cant just hide the truth and recreate whatever new thing you want But Thats how the China and Chinese evolved for thousands of years Like it could be martial arts rice noodles or the dragon all of them came from outside Then when I saw the film the first scene itself cleared my doubt It states the film was based on the legend I thought it was a good start after the misleading promosrnrnSo this is Chinas effort to make a product at home par with Hollywood They had hired top technicians from the west thats including Matt Damon With this kind of attempt they should have triumphed Yeah the graphics were good and then if you check it out the end credits it was actually not a pure Chinese made product as what we see on the screen which was 99 per cent Chinese cast Kung Fu Yoga is a fine example what the made in China looks likernrnThe director is known for traditional films like mixing art martial arts and culture particularly the middle age I like his films of the 00s but this one was utterly commercial crap When it comes to the ideas for the scenes every segment and every frame reminded me some Hollywoods greatest graphic film from the recent decade Particularly the monsters as the zombies from World War Z and the Chinese soldiers totally replicates the Elves of Woodland Realm That proves the Chinese are masters of copyingduplicating IT HAS A DECENT VISUAL BUT NOT FRESH VISION They should have handed it over entirely except producing it for the better outcomernrnIt is the early 11th century at one of the sections of northern China wall where a couple of white men caught by the Chinese army after they were chased by a group of bandits They have come with an agenda but theres something big is going on First they have to win the Chinese trust and so they succeed on that but things changes as the weather of the place has changed Besides they have no choice than to cooperate with them but then the differences divide the two men Who takes what path and their fates are decided at the films climaxrnrn They have trained all their lives for this warrnrnMany western actors filmmakers had tried their luck in Chinese filmdom but not all were succeeded Tapping Chinese market is not that simple There are too many complications like restriction in thematic and using content in the story If that complies then they must use Chinese cast and crew for some percentage From all the greatest surprise was like Jimmy Kimmel said why would Damon had given up the Oscar award winning role from his own production for this cheap flick from the eastrnrnI always appreciate the good films no matter where it had come from It all depends on the quality and the contents but sometimes there is exemption if the production was under a limited small cost Theres no such excuse for this film Besides my issue was not the graphics except borrowing the ideas from others but it was the poor screenplay You can clearly say that Im not happy with this one This is just another film that looks like a computer game as similar to the Resident Evil film seriesrnrnThe west had given up on digital 3D but China has a special obsession with that and so am I That is the reason those failed films bet against the Dollars which were strongly influenced by that technology such as Age of Extinction Warcraft et cetera survived by earning Yuan Like I mentioned the director is not this kind of cheap filmmaker But it clearly understandable that he wanted to give what the domestic audience wanted a good digital 3D film For that it has to be full scale actionadventure not filled with drama kind hes famous forrnrnThis film lacks character developments as well as the story You might enjoy it if you like actions Even though many of them are silly like acrobat women jumping down to just kill onetwo monsters On the other hand they are the baits without followup strategic offense Hence well planned suicide Like that they just wanted to give some actions without any logic behind The common man like Chinese people Common means Communism definition might be fooled not the rest of the world So this film is not everybodys suitable It is a watchable film but why No worth at allrnrn_310_ I suuuuuper

of this movie The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really really good The scene pictured on the movie poster were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mias bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautifulrnrnEverything else about this movie isokay Okay acting okay story etc  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey different tastes and all thatrnrnI cannot make up my mind about ending On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on On the other hand I have to commend the writerdirector for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit differentrnrnI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the storyrnrnAnyway I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would Theyd crossed each others life while chasing their dreamsrnrnI am not a big fan of modern musical films So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst The film opened with a song that I was not happy because I did not like the verse or the music And again to say the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film rnrnThe best part of the film was those song fades away as the film progresses But I kind of liked the dramastory part and the climax track with the quick flashback kind of Till that scene I was considering it an average film but that one scene changed my stance So now I think it is a good film but winning 6 Oscars I dont know it deserved thatrnrnYes the director is known for making music and musical film but he has not made many Hes young and so his career Yep I loved Whiplash One of my all time favourite If that film had won 10 Oscars I would have not surprised at all After that flick the people were anticipating to exceed that success in this film As it was received no doubt for those people it was a different flick but not for me Especially if you watch lots of Indian films By the way the film characters were nice and so the story but not the songsrnrnGosling and Stone were performed well The chemistry between them was great The narration was going decently until the end which reminded me Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya ending that I was not happy about yet something different than usual Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion just to bring a change in storytelling Overall an enjoyable film most people would love it Some like me would say it is a decent flick but theres always a few who would never favour it Yet worth a watchrnrn_710_ Undeniably well put together and entertaining even if it certainly chooses style over substancernrnemLa La Landem is an absolutely gorgeouslooking film from the costumes to the cinematography to the choreography The musical numbers are pleasant too It is a little light on story not that it isnt entertaining  it is They were evidently to me going for an artsy film and they nailed that I just personally wanted more depth to the plot rather than a song every few minutesrnrnRyan Gosling is probably one of my favourite actors around right now in the argument at least and he is very good here So is Emma Stone who is arguably the films standout I wanted to watch more of Stones work even before this so I knew  along with Gosling  I was going to enjoy the cast They work excellently as a duo Elsewhere John Legends role is a tad out of place even if its good to see himrnrn4 It might make for lame viewing if you absolutely do not like musicals but otherwise its 100

city to deeply love and deeply hate and it is impossible to describe that to someone who has never lived there The closest a nonresident can come to gaining an understanding of that sensation is by watching Damien Chazelles _La La Land_ On the one hand there are the warm sunkissed beaches the millionaires and the secluded canyons of the San Gabriel mountains Its the promised land of golden dreams for actors musicians and writers where success is always right around the corner On the other hand youll find smog traffic and abject failure Los Angeles with all its promises is a pendulum that swings widely Really a good movie which justifies the hype around itrnrnWho doesnt remember La La Land It was released in theaters in 2016 and was one of the most viewed and acclaimed films of that year It was a film that was virtually carried in the lap between festivals and awards of the seventh art and that seemed destined to clean them all up as Titanic had done two decades before When he arrived at the Oscars he had practically nominations in almost every category where he could be included Of the fourteen nominations however it collected only six statuettes with the seventh  Best Film  slipping through the fingers in what was the most absolute embarrassment in the entire history of the Hollywood Academy the infamous but historic exchange of envelopes that we all have in our memory But when I said only it is necessary to put things in perspective what many producers would not have given to win six Oscars in one of their films Like it or not it was a great achievement and La La Land received a welldeserved accolade that nightrnrnThe film directed by newcomer Damien Chazelle is a worthy homage to musicals from Hollywoods golden age and features a generally sympathetic script an aspiring starlet trying to become an actress meets and falls in love with a purist jazz pianist who wants to restore peoples interest in the musical genre he loves and which he feels is slowly being lost It is their mutual passion that makes them not give up on their respective dreams but it will also end up dictating that both follow their own paths And indeed the films bittersweet and slightly too realistic ending shockingly clashes with the magic felt throughout the rest of the film Its like having a very beautiful dream where anything is possible with some effort and serious work and ending up seeing that dream trampled by a heavy raw and often unfair reality And it must be said although the characters seem likeable they are selfish and only think about themselves and their interests They seem to stick together only as long as it really benefits their individual interestsrnrnAlthough I dont like the characters very much Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling offer us in the film two magnificent works of interpretation and also of singing and dancing Gosling showed hidden talents on the keyboard of a piano and both are very good at choreography although singing is not particularly strong point for either Both are young and it is quite possible that they will give us even better dramatic performances in the future The rest of the films cast hardly matters its one of those movies where the main characters are so overwhelming and omnipresent that theres no room for anyone elsernrnTechnically the film has several frankly good aspects that deserve our attention and our praise For starters the films honest and intelligent way of recreating and inserting scenes and dance routines from the great musicals of the past from Shall We Dance to Singing in the Rain and West Side Story The scenarios the elements the routines are there The cinematography colorful frank generous with light is magnificent and a feast for the eyes The editing was done in an excellent and very skillful way The scenery couldnt be better taking advantage of the Hollywood Hills or the Griffith Observatory in the best way The soundtrack melodies and songs are excellent A fullyfledged musical of the likes we havent seen on the big screen in decades This move is almost perfect in every respect It will draw a laugh it will draw a tear and it will definitely get your foot tapping I have to admit the reality ending crushed my enjoyment a little I understand why the director did it but that doesnt mean I have to like it This movie is the best movie there will ever be Ryan and Emma

with some pretty heavy themes for an animated childrens movie Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here From panic attacks to

witty and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplifiedrnrnWhat I also didnt expect was that the action sequences would be so wellchoreographed and beautifully animated and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at timesrnrnI adored this film I think its Dreamworks best film since Megamind and its easily the best true family film of the year I cant think for a minute that this would have worked at

I last read the Goldilocks story and try as I might I just couldnt remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma Its pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasnt really improved much since Evita 1996 Its a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty affection determination etc but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big

wondering What the fuck happenedrnrnBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or twornrnOne thing I really liked about the first movie was as you can read in my review about that one  that it was a no bullshit kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets kind of movie John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins safe havens hidden shops for guns classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc etcrnrnIn this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end although one of the two adversaries suffer a more permanent setback than the otherrnrnWorse is that in my opinion in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that onernrnThere are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top No one absolutely no one seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick This makes the action feel more like a parody ala Kill Bill than a more serious action revenge movie Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point Heck if this would have been a Star Trek TOS episode Hollywoods entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is  unbelievablernrnI did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is again to me at least not a happy onernrnHaving said that the action sequences are as cool crazy but cool and violent as they are unbelievable I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car thoughrnrnOverall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars All eyes on him and all guns pointed at himrnrnIt was not an attracting title for a sequel The first film was good completely an unexpected but I was expecting this one even though not as much as I was excited to see Jack Reacher 2 That film was good but did not meet with its first films merit And this sequel really amazing One of best followup flick and better than the original That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the onernrnEntirely different than the first I meant the storyline A new action a new adventure and even on a bigger scale Though the initial parts were average I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr Wick took in his hand but what followed after made the film great definitely not to be missed for that alone Especially if you are an ardent action film fan For me that reminded me Kill Bill but they are not the same kind except the fighting concept with hundredsrnrnContinued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended Now the retired assassin John Wick forced to take a final job but soon he finds he was backstabbed Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him theres no way he could get out of it easily So he has to fight them all just in order to survive Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay thats ends with left open the door for the third filmrnrnNow this became a stylish franchise Thats what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick He did not write it but he knew exactly how to create them technically perfectly Besides he got wonderful dedicated actors to achieve that Not just Reeves but all were awesome Believe the third film would be a kickass particularly the pace that could match with likes Crank Just watch it already and be prepared for the next the mega finalernrn_810_ Picking almost right where the previous film ended John Wick Chapter 2 deals with the consequences of Wicks return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin withrnrnAs expected it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie with the revelation that theres a high council of sorts other Continental hotels around the world and a very widespread network of assassinsrnrnAlso as expected it ups the ante with bigger action sequences and a much higher body count We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose whose character communicates solely through sign language in many cases this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them but its not the case here  and is used only as an aspect of the character smartly done Keanu Reeveslets the Reeves of old come through a couple times with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections Ian McShanes Winston expands a little bit although he still refers to John as Jonathan which is just wrong If its supposed to be some kind of an injoke with them they dont reveal anything about it Again I think theres more going on with Lance Reddicks hotel manager than theyre letting on And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasnt in more of the film as hes always funrnrnAgain the world is very wide and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld There is an indication that thats not the case here and there but we never get to meet anyone who doesnt know whats going on which keeps some of that suspicion uprnrnThe plot follows a pretty basic structure Actually it follows a pretty rigid structure In a two hour movie it can be broken down almost exactly into halfhour sequences something that struck me as a little odd There are some minor plot twist Nothing major or out of the blue but at least there was an attemptrnrnSo now we come down to it Is it better or worse than the first movie Well I would have to say yes It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie expanding on the mythology and the characters At the same time it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger badder sequels fall into which is that with the bigger scope it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own In fact they may have expanded the world too quickly going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and while the ambition is admirable at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chewrnrnStill an enjoyable action film and if you liked the first film youll most likely enjoy this one There are two franchises that my wife loves and forced me to watchrnrn The first is The Fast and the Furious and the Second is John WickrnrnThe Fast and the Furious is low on plot high on action and vapid and horrible Its pure action and its too and I cant believe I am saying this but too machismo hardcore for me to really likernrnSorry but I couldnt think of any other way to describe itrnrnIt seems like it is mindless action that is trying too hard to be cool and edgyrnrnJohn Wick is low on plot high on action and vapid in story but its super fun and stylized cool and an absolute pleasure to watchrnrnMaybe its because I like Shoot em up bang bang movies a lot more than drive around voom voom stories or maybe its just that John Wick is the film franchise that doesnt have to try to be cool and the Fast and the Furious tries too hardrnrnOr maybe its simply that the stylized violence in the John Wick franchise is just so much fun to watch and if you ask me to not be analytical Im going to say that that is the answerrnrnIts just so much fun to watch and movies should be fun to watch or they should be emotional or they should make you thinkrnrnAnd ultimately sometimes you are just in the mood for something fun and John Wick is a fun movie All three of them are fun movies and that is what most movies should strive for being entertaining and fun In terms of sequels you will not be able to find a better film than John Wick Chapter 2 The sequel takes every aspect of the first and expands on it making it bigger and better but still having the same drawbacks of the first The story and performances are not the greatest but do enough to drive the action and film forward I would argue that the plot here is slightly improved due to the larger scope The assassin underworld is expanded as we get to see more subsects and players in the space There are complex relationships that Wick has with many characters in this film and although we never see what occurred in the past the history is there in terms of their interactions This is especially apparent in the end when all of Wicks former coworkers start entering into the fold This had to be my favorite part of the film Rome as a setting was great and the underground tunnels were a fun environment for Wick to play in The action was brilliant once again with more weapons and creative kills included I loved that we got to see Wick use the pencil on two of the guards There were some beautiful shots with fantastic color due to the city light scape The use of water reflections was done well although I do think there might have been a few too many The pace towards the end started to slow down I feel as though this movie should have been maybe 1015 minutes shorter Despite that this movie was once again a fantastic entry into the series and on par with the first in terms of quality action and enjoyment rnrnScore 79rnVerdict Great emJohn Wick Chapter 2em felt a tad different to me even if I still had exactly the same reaction to it  enjoymentrnrnKeanu Reeves fits the lead role extremely well he certainly elevates the films with his performances Id say the supporting cast are an improvement from the original Riccardo Scamarcio alongside the likes of Laurence Fishburne Ruby Rose and Common are good to watch More of Ian McShane is welcomed toornrnThe difference that I felt was that there seemed to be many more talky moments the preceding film felt like it had more walltowall action than this I could be wrong but Im not complaining either way  just an observation Im interested to see how the third film panned out Ok so its not quite as good as the first movie but how often does that actually happen Mr Wick is cool again The action is cool again The villains are cool again Except for that silly little girl who doesnt speak of course But again the addiction to this movie lies in the multiple layers added to further build the world these characters inhabit Great stuff Just as good as the 1st Has some incredible fight scenes He takes a beating and just keeps on going', NOW());

beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle  let alone use one After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment Hacksaw Ridge From where a true legend is bornrnrnAs is a Gibson trademark the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact Amongst the carnage which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry Doss brilliantly brought to life by Garfield comes to the fore From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story 910 Tribute to a reallife WW2 conscientious collaborator rnrnAfter Pearl Harbor Desmond Doss of Lynchburg Virginia joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector his goal was to save lives not kill which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers until they observe his bravery in combat Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant rnrnBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson Hacksaw Ridge 2016 is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war This is an interesting reallife tale that needs to be told and Hacksaw Ridge is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters which makes them uninteresting The latter is in contrast to the outstanding Platoon 1986 which featured several welldefined charactersrnrnThe movies about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense He thinks this is supported by the Bible and specifically the New Testament but it isnt The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified Christ instructions to turn the cheek related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face which was an insult in that culture In other words we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day The Old Testament teaches this as well A fool shows his annoyance at once but a prudent man overlooks an insult Proverbs 1216 So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense he wasnt referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of ones nation rnrnFor proof Jesus ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thievesmurderers in their travels You see Christ  his disciples werent absolute pacifists On two occasions the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple  throwing over tables swinging the whip and yelling He was a Holy Terror pure  simple and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder Mark 111518 Harmless pacifists dont inspire fear and provoke murder plots Moreover Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals domestic  foreign who threaten the lives of citizens This includes the right to execute when appropriate The majority of sane Christians realize this but there are a few extremists like Doss in the movie who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate Theyre wrong Sometimes its necessary like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor unprovoked murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100rnrnThe film runs 2 hour 19 minutes and was shot in New South Wales AustraliarnrnGRADE B A really good movie which only lacks in some detailsrnrnThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson He had previously made at least one militarythemed film We Were Soldiers set in Vietnam However it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes in my opinion by following the Doss family a family from rural Virginia and the trajectory of one of their children DesmondrnrnSon of an extraordinarily devout mother raised an Adventist Desmond learns as a child to deny violence the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly but in real life it was a fight between Desmonds father and his brotherinlaw and to strictly follow his faith and religion When the US joins the Allies in World War II the brothers decide to enlist but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms that is as a combat rescuer exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon Of course the US military isnt going to take this in the best lightrnrnThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively Still it is necessary to be frank they are excellent battle scenes with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness Unfortunately the dialogues arent very good they sound a bit cliché and its annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmonds first wife but things dont go well and the material is frankly poorrnrnIn general Gibson does a good job of directing although that wont come as a surprise to the most attentive observer He already has a number of hits in his filmography and together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper is one of the actors I most like to see in the directors chair Until now I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project Some I just dont know very well Andrew Garfield is an example Ive seen him in other works but the actor never completely convinced me so I was very impressed with his work here Sam Worthington also impressed me very well although hes an actor I recognize more easily and Ive seen him work well in other films Hugo Weaving is excellent and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand perhaps due to the weak material receivedrnrnTechnically the film has a lot of good things to look at starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to reenact the combat and war environment from the recruiting camp to the field Unlike many films from his past where the director trampled on historical truth he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here The visual and special effects are really very good and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism especially in the combat scenes The sets are interesting and the costumes too I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more and the camera moves intelligently putting us in the fight making us suffer with those soldiers and feel what they felt what Gregsons soundtrack Williams accentuates even more I dont want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor I mean hes been in plenty of movies that I love but like Clint Eastwood he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actorrnrnHacksaw Ridge is just one of those films where he does a great job unfortunately it is Mel Gibson so its overthetop carnage that is not at all underplayed But you cant fault Gibson for making a Gibson film you should really know as much coming inrnrnAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act which might not win him a reward but it certainly should that is a something that could get a man canonized and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years He seems like a real actor in this accent and allrnrnAnd then of course its the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives and in the end thats pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out which is probably the point despite the overthetop carnage', NOW());

of course is not at all unusual as well as with a lot of the actual viewers of this movie by saying that I really liked this moviennI guess that I can to some extent understand that some viewers are disappointed That would be the viewers that have read the comics that the movie is based on Unfortunately someone in the production team decided to take bits and pieces from several comic books and mash them together as well as change some key elements It is really annoying when that is done It is usually an indication that somewhere some dumbass who did not understand and certainly did not respect the source material had way too much influence on the production It is really a shame since the comic book from wich the core of the of the story seems to be taken is certainly more than good enough to stand on its ownnnWell luckily the mashup that they produced is actually bloody good Something wich in my experience is quite rare The Valerian comics lends themselves very well as a base for some spectacular scifi  with plenty of weird creatures and spectacular scenery Add Luc Besson to the mix and you have to spell spectacular in all capsnnThis is definitely a Luc Besson movie Plenty of action spectacular yes I repeat myself but this movie deserves it scenery a fair amount of weirdness In short a lot of stuff this particular viewer likesnnThe mashed up story is not too bad It is predictable as hell of course even though it is not following the comics but it is making a decent job of tying together all the action and FX and the action and FX is really the main reason to watch this movie after allnI have to say that I think most of the characters were pretty okay It seems that the performance of the two main characters where generally not so well received by a lot of people I guess I can somewhat understand that but I still cannot refrain from saying Read the fucking comics Okay it is a French comic and there are probably few people outside of France or at least outside of Europe that have read them Me being one of the few of course Anyway Valerian and Laureline are supposed to be somewhat weird silly and a little bit childish Personally I think they did a fair job of interpreting the comic book characters the way they should be We probably have Luc Besson to thank for not getting a some Hollywood thirteen on a dozen charactersnnI do miss some bits of the real comics though The transmutation animal played a much more visible role in the comic and so did the three information peddlers wich gave a much more professional impression in the comic book by the way I also think it was a shame that they changed the story of the Muh so much Their role in the comic book was much more impressive to mennStill most of the bits and pieces that is taken from the different comic books and mashed together are quite faithfully reproduced at least visually and the results turned out really really good as far as I am concernednnTo wrap it up to me this movie was a fun spectacular action filled scifi extravaganza A typical Luc Besson movie and I mean that in a good way I like this Movie very much It reminds a bit about Avatar  John Carter I can not Understand why it did Not make it to the Australian Cinemas For this type of High Budget it would be worth watching in 3D CinemasrnI gave it 1010  A disorrienting but somewhat delightful run through all manner of scifi imaginations The acting was not good and the storyline was sometimes incoherent yet I have this strange urge to rewatch this thing Its harmless fascinating fun in ways like the original

plutonium in BerlinrnrnAs a spy thriller there is enough tension thrills and a serpentine story with several twistsrnrnHowever the film is overlong and I felt that some of the action scenes consisted of myriad chase scenes that were stylishly done but nothing really memorable liked the Burj Khalifa climbing scene Excellent story line with tremendous stunts by Tom Cruise himself This movie is worth every penny that you spend I have to say I have not been a great fan of the Mission Impossible movies Sure theres plenty of action and cool stunts but I do not feel they follow the spirit of the TVshow In the TVshow they got their mission and then they completed it tricking the bad guys with the full backing of the IMF team No political bullshit betrayal of the team and such like nonsensernrnHowever in pretty much every movie Ethan or the entire IMF team was betrayed or set up and he had to not only complete his mission but clear IMF from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up The movies have been Mission Impossible in name only I wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the showrnrnIn this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal Shit that I could be without But at least IMF and Ethans team are on his side throughout the movie There are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned

commits an atrocity to end all atrocities in the name of creating a new world order The first twenty minutes are poor predictable and formulaic and I will admit to having started to write it off Once Henry Cavill August Walker joins the gang however and they start to search for the missing cores it becomes fastmoving actionpacked and enjoyable  with plenty of crosses and doublecrosses Rebecca Ferguson still always comes across the same whomever she plays but that works for this one and the team spirit really comes across Sure it isnt going to win a Booker for the writing but it travels the

humor This time instead of a board game Jumanji has morphed into a video game that sucks its unsuspecting victims into its deadly world Welcome to the Jungle leans into all the video game tropes with hilarious results with jokes about skills lives NPCs boss battles and more The movie is at its best with all the humor surrounding the bodyswapped teens dealing with the games characters they now

Dom Vin Diesel et al become the targets of Dante Jason Momoa The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars Now I was thinking this is going to be rubbish Well it isnt actually Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery its still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively setpiece car chases that trash just about every city in the world  especially Rome The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time

silliness Fast X feels like its headed toward the end of the road a dead end from which the series will never return But if youre searching for a bit of mindless entertainment its also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season Ive more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie its becoming harder and harder to really be entertained not to mention care one iota about these characters I will say Jason Momoa in whatever he was doing was a hoot in the coldblooded

Scorsese _Taxi Driver_ _The Last Temptation of Christ_ _The Aviator_ whose _GoodFellas_ 1990 and _Casino_ 1995 are two of the most celebrated gangster movies ever made although I think Im the only person on the planet who dislikes _GoodFellas_ I love _Casino_ though An oldschool auteur in the mould of filmmakers such as Francis Ford Coppola Brian De Palma Michael Mann Terrence Malick and Oliver Stone Scorsese Malick and Mann are three of the very few such filmmakers who remain as relevant today as they were when they first broke into the business I personally havent really liked much of what hes done in the last couple of decades but theres no denying Scorsese is a filmmaker who still seems to have a lot to sayrnrn_The Irishman_ has received a rapturous reception with critics and audiences proclaiming it as one of Scorseses best movies And although I certainly dont disagree that it has many masterful elements but its just too blooming long taking far too much time to get to the last act which is superb Shorten it by 20 minutes in the midsection and you have a masterpiece Now dont get me wrong I have no problem with long films  Coppolas _The Godfather Part II_ 202 minutes is one of the finest films ever made three of my alltime favourite movies are the Directors Cuts of Sergio Leones _Once Upon a Time in America_ 250 Kevin Costners _Dances with Wolves_ 236 and Malicks _The Tree of Life_ 190 I adore Kenneth Branaghs _Hamlet_ 242 and Im a big fan of films such as Jerzy Hoffmans _Potop_ 315 Bernardo Bertoluccis _1900_ 317 and Béla Tarrs _Sátántangó_ 442yep 442 However such length has to be narratively justified and I just felt that in _The Irishman_ it wasnt A runtime of around 170180 minutes would have been perfect but as it stands the films 206 minutes occasionally feel padded and dare I say it selfindulgent Nevertheless the acting is universally superb the directing is more contemplative than weve seen from Scorsese in a while Thelma Schoonmakers editing is predictably awesome and Rodrigo Prietos cinematography is flawless If only it was 20 minutes shorterrnrnThe film opens in 2003 as we meet an elderly Frank Sheeran Robert De Niro A World War II veteran who was stationed in Italy Sheeran now lives in a nursing home and is close to death Wanting to die with something of a clear conscience he decides to speak about his time as the goto hitman for the Northeastern Pennsylvaniabased Bufalino crime family We then cut to 1975 as Sheeran family patriarch Russell Bufalino Joe Pesci and their wives are embarking on a threeday drive to attend a wedding As they pass by the spot where Sheeran and Bufalino first met we cut to 1954 with Sheeran working as a truck driver for a slaughterhouse Although he has a reputation for reliability on the side hes selling more than a little of the meat to Felix Skinny Razor DiTullio Bobby Cannavale a wiseguy working for the Philadelphia and New Jerseybased Bruno crime family led by Angelo Bruno Harvey Keitel an ally and friend of Russell When Sheeran sells the entire contents of his truck however turning up at the delivery location with an empty storage the company charge him with theft but hes successfully represented by Bill Bufalino Ray Romano Russells cousin Sheeran and Russell become good friends and soon Russell has Sheeran carrying out various hits Loyal to the Bruno and Bufalino families and adept at his job Sheeran quickly moves up the underworld ladder and Bufalino introduces him to Jimmy Hoffa Al Pacino The president of the Mobfunded Teamsters union Hoffa is facing investigation by the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management and is struggling to deal with rising teamster Anthony Pro Provenzano Stephen Graham Hoffa is volatile unpredictable confrontational and believes himself untouchable so Bufalino wants Sheeran to babysit him and try to keep him out of trouble Hoffa and Sheeran hit it off and soon Sheeran is Hoffas unofficial bodyguard However despite Sheerans best efforts as the years go by Hoffa continues to antagonise his Mob backers and some of them soon come to see him as more of a liability than an assetrnrnOriginally set at Paramount when _The Irishman_s budget started pushing 150m before shooting had even begun the studio deemed the project too expensive and dropped it Then came Netflix who not only put up the money but they also offered Scorsese a near unheardof degree of creative control  the kind of control that almost no one person has been given over a project this big since Michael Cimino pissed away 44m 115m in todays money of United Artists money on Heavens Gate 1980 a film originally budgeted at 116m and which earned back only 3m at the box office ending the _auteur_driven New Hollywood era nearly bankrupting UA and fundamentally altering the way movie studios did business Netflixs involvement with _The Irishman_ is an interesting situation because here you have a film that simply could not have been made through the modern studio system at least not in its current form Netflix is usually derided for their purchase of movies originally intended for theatrical release which are then packaged as Netflix Originals with many predicting that streaming services will ultimately destroy the cinema industry entirely As with many such films _The Irishman_ was given a limited theatrical release to ensure it qualified for Oscar consideration Netflix _really_ to have a Best Picture winner in their catalogue However disgruntled about there being only a three week gap between theatrical release and streaming debut major cinema chains such as AMC Cinemark Regal and Cineplex all refused to carry it with AMCs Adam Aron stating they would only be open to showing the film if Netflix _respects the decadesold theatrical window that suggests that movies come to theatres first for a couple of months and then go to the home_ For all that however its hard for a lover of cinema not to celebrate Netflix stepping in to save such an ambitious and artistic film to say nothing of the unprecedented control they gave Scorsese It was a great PR move sure but it was also a massive financial risk so you really cant condemn their involvementrnrnLooking very briefly at the reallife background of the films narrative most historians today dismiss Sheerans account of how important he was to the Bufalino family and several of his claims have been proven as fabrications for more information on this see Bill Tonellis August 2019 article The Lies of the Irishman for _Slate_ and Jack Goldsmiths September 2019 article Jimmy Hoffa and The Irishman A True Crime Story for _The New York Review_ Nevertheless the film uses Sheerans book as the main source for the story so its best just to put the many historical embellishments to the back of your mind Aside from killing Hoffa some of Sheerans most flamboyant claims include killing Joe Gallo delivering a truckload of weaponry to soldiers preparing for the Bay of Pigs Invasion handing the truck over to E Howard Hunt no less giving a bag containing three rifles to a pilot days before Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy and delivering a suitcase containing a 500000 bribe to Attorney General John N Mitchell to pass on to Nixon Historians however tell us he did none of these things maintaining that he was a lowlevel goon with a drinking problem who was never assigned to any important task This has been corroborated by several former Mob bosses who knew Sheeran According to Tonellirnrn_not a single person I spoke with who knew Sheeran from Philly  and I interviewed cops and criminals and prosecutors and reporters  could remember even a suspicion that he had ever killed anyone_rnrnSo either he was the greatest and most clandestine Mob hitman of all time or he was full of shitrnrnIrrespective of this however _The Irishman_ is a film written in regret Scorsese has often been accused of making Mob recruitment films and its wellknown that reallife gangsters love _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_ In _The Irishman_ however theres a thematic maturity not present in those films  the violence is presented with a degree more solemnity the emotional fallout of such a life with a degree more finality Much of this is tied up in Sheerans daughter Peggy played by Lucy Gallina as a child and Anna Paquin as an adult An almost completely wordless role Peggy is introduced in a scene in which she watches her father viciously beat the grocer for whom she works because he pushed her The impression of him which this gives her is something Sheeran spends much of the rest of the film trying to amelioraternrnAnother important element in the films thematic complexity particularly the theme of death is that as each gangster appears for the first time a subtitle tells us who they are but also lists the date of their deaths and how they were murdered which almost all were Theres no better illustration of just how concerned the film is with the nature of transience  every single one of these guys is a colossus in their own mind and each deems themselves invincible as do we all when young Yet none of them make it out of life alive In the films last act this theme is distilled down to its very essence essentially positing that the only important thing you leave behind is your relationships with other people and Sheeran has badly mismanaged his resulting in him sitting alone in a nursing home at Christmas waiting to die In _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_ the protagonists lose their wealth possessions status and so on but in _The Irishman_ the loss is more existential  Sheeran loses his soul Telling himself for much of the film that hes an inherently decent person insofar as he loves his family and is loyal to his friends its only at the very end that he comes to realise he was a monster Scorsese is here showing us that men like Sheeran and Bufalino must erase their humanity to function effectively in this world or conversely that they can function effectively because they have no humanity to begin with suggesting that men with no conscience are not only not men theyre not even alivernrnThis issue comes to a head in a remarkably wellacted scene towards the end of the film in which Sheeran calls the widow of a man he has recently murdered all the mans wife knows at the time of the call is that her husband is missing Assuring her that hes there for her should she need anything Sheeran urges her to try to think positive explaining that he believes the man will turn up eventually It clearly causes him a degree of pain but the fact that he can do it at all speaks to his sociopathy if not necessarily his psychopathology The last act as the violence settles and the zingers and insults dry up is remarkably bleak in a way that the last acts of _GoodFellas_ and _Casino_ arent and as we watch Sheeran sitting in that nursing home taking stock spelling out his regrets reminiscing about his actions as a young man its impossible not to see the meta dimension  Scorsese himself looking back on his career remembering the classics of yesteryear keenly aware that oldage is beginning to creep up on himrnrnIn terms of the acting the closest we get to a poor performance is Pacino who portrays Hoffa as if he was playing well Al Pacino This is arguably the biggest hes gone since Taylor Hackfords _Devils Advocate_ 1997 a film in which he quite literally played Satan But in terms of portraying Hoffa look at footage of the real Hoffa then watch both The Irishman and Danny DeVitos _Hoffa_ 1992 in which Jack Nicholson plays the character and tell me who gives the more authentic performance Dont get me wrong Pacino is fun to watch I would gladly see an entire film composed of nothing but him and Stephen Graham insulting one another and most of the laughs come from his overthetop antics but its not an especially accurate depiction of the real man As for De Niro this is his first notphonedin performance in decades possibly since _Casino_ and Manns _Heat_ 1995 and he imbues the character with real interiority and complex psychology without diluting Sheerans inherent inhumanity However the real standout performance is Pesci Nine years since his last liveaction film Pesci falls back into the groove without missing a beat However those looking for the fireworks of Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro will be disappointed  this is literally the inverse of such performances Pescis Bufalino is quiet calm considered highly intelligent but cold and sociopathic the kind of man who wouldnt so much beat your head in but would order someone else to do so without giving it a second thoughtrnrnIf the film has a single problem its the runtime Depending on your perspective 206 minutes is either too long or ironically not long enough I could certainly see this story working well as a sixhour miniseries but as a film it needs trimming As mentioned above the last act is devastating theres little tension as such but there sure is pathos However by the time we got to this point I was starting to feel the film had outstayed its welcome when I should have been the most heavily invested in the story This has been a recurrent problem in recent Scorsese films most notably _The Aviator_ 2004 _The Wolf of Wallstreet_ 2013 and the horrendous _Silence_ 2016 but this is the first time hes strayed from overlong into selfindulgence The film simply doesnt warrant this length whole scenes could easily be removed without compromising the story the character beats or the emotion This is mostly felt in the long middle section in which Scorsese broadens the story to take in the Kennedy and Nixon presidencies without ever really tying the historical material to Sheerans narration Presumably hes trying to show the interconnectedness between the underworld and politics but given the time he spends on it that isnt especially clearrnrnAnother problem albeit a smaller one is the digital deaging Apart from a scene showing a 20something Sheeran in which De Niro looks like hes made of cheap wax I thought the technology was deployed pretty successfully its a little jolting at first but easy to get used to What stood out however was the tired bodies beneath those deaged faces This is most notable in the scene where Sheeran beats up Peggys boss  a pivotal moment that drives a permanent wedge between the two as she witnesses for the first time his savagery Except the beating is pathetic  the kicks are about five miles away from the mans face and De Niros exhausted stomps wouldnt flatten a wet cardboard box Its a shame as its a good scene but the lack of correlation between face and body is undeniably jarring Another issue is one that has cropped up in all of Scorseses Mob films  glorification Obviously _The Irishman_ is about the toxic masculinity of this world and the lonely endgame if one even gets to the endgame but much as was the case with his frankly stomachchurning softening of Jordan Belfort in _Wolf of Wall Street_ Scorsese runs a very real risk of glamorising what he claims to be condemningrnrnWith 20 minutes shaved off this could have been one of the best films of the century thus far For me _The Irishman_ was a very good movie but certainly not the masterpiece many others have felt it to be But thats just me and I can certainly recognise and celebrate such ambitious and _auteur_driven filmmaking especially coming as it does at a time when more and more it feels like films are being made by committees rather than by artists Arguably Scorseses most eschatological film certainly since _Kundun_ 1997 _The Irishman_ is essentially a story of how one man lost his soul and by extension how the world for which he lost it

of the most talented filmmakers ever With Robert De Niro delivering his best performance of the decade Al Pacino going crazy and Joe Pesci brilliantly coming out of retirement The Irishman is a wonderfullywritten very long story about friendship and life The best editing Thelma Schoonmaker of the year makes the runtime smoother but it still drags on for too long I also feel that Anna Paquins

interest And while I dont at all mind lengthy movies Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now are two of my favorite movies this one was probably a good 20minutes too long IMO That said nice to see De

favourite of mine in 2016 but something about this ones hopelessness drew me in more  odd I know Lanthimos films have characters stuck in dead end situations where they are able to make a choice but the results of the options are bad and worse Its a dour story and the film is relentlessly unsettling but this is what Ive come to expect and want out of this Greek maestrornrnSacred Deer is a suburban Greek tragedy that draws inspiration from Euripides _Iphigenia in Aulis_  a character even mentions this title in a key scene  and it plays out both as youd imagine and with great shock and

Colin Farrell in top form bringing the odd words of Lanthimos and Filippou to life  albeit a very very strange life Farrell having worked with Lanthimos on The Lobster had nothing but high praise for the director during tonights QA after the screening of the film He even said they were planning another project to work on together Hes slowly becoming a muse and their relationship is turning into a DiCaprioScorsese type partnership except I look forward to these way way morernrnThe audience I was in had a hard time with this film  there was audible shock and disgust during the film and the applause as it ended was slight I think people were genuinely scandalized by this one and that makes me like it even more Keep shocking audiences Lanthimos you Greek bastard Ill be in line every single time I am a big fan of some of Yorgos Lanthimos earlier work so _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ which I had been told in no uncertain terms would be a straight up horror movie was well and truly on the agenda for 2017 Unfortunately I found that not only was _Sacred Deer_ not at all a horror but more importantly that it lacked the dark whimsy of something truly odd like the directors previous film _Lobster_ Instead it opts for an outright uncomfortable tone The world is real boringly so and it is only the characters who seem unbelievable Which is a 180 on the sort of absurdism I usually gravitate towards That said _Sacred Deer_ still contains some beautiful cinematography and a couple of the most genuine laughoutloud moments Ive seen in a movie all yearrnrn_Final rating½  Had a lot

did not impress me at all Very interesting ideas atrocious presentations Dogtooth was indecipherable and The Lobster is cruel ugly and not humorous in any fashion Ive no idea why its billed as a black

straightforward despite its cryptic nature a bit more involved in some form of reality we can recognize and less inference as to what the hey is really happening But I sure watched it w more interest

concept is brilliant buddy cop  _Lord of the Rings_ sequel What youd expect is a somewhat humorous popcorn action flick Instead Bright turns out to be quite dark and deep Its about racial prejudice

minority Its a clever bit of allegory if a bit obvious Less obvious is the portrayal of the Elves who turn out to be the arrogant uberentitled 01percenters If you always thought the elves in LOTR were

Noomi Rapace seems to have been born to play an evil ElfrnrnUnfortunately after a lot of gritty action superbly directed by Ayer the ending arrives as a bit of an actionmovie cliche There was so much more meat here in the characters in the politics in the weird magical backdrop I was hoping for a more characterdriven ending instead of the usual mindless bruteforce headbashing as superbly exemplified by every DC comix movie of recent yearsrnrnNonetheless Bright is well worth a watch It fails in some of its higher aspirations but reverts to being a very entertaining buddycop romp Which isnt so bad Ninety nine times out of a hundred whenever I have a varying opinion with critics at large I understand how we have both come to our separate opinions and move on with my day About once a year though there is a movie where all I can think about the vast majority disliking a movie is This world is fucking crazy The last time it happened was with _Chappie_ and today it happened again with _Bright_rnrn_Final rating½  I really liked it Would strongly recommend you give it your time_ Everything about Bright is a true achievement in being terrible For a movie with a very interesting world and a cool premise Max Landis and David Ayer and the cast managed to create true dog shit The largest problem lays with Landiss terrible script with some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and Will Smiths acting and what I can only assume to be adlibbing Every single actoractress does a terrible job but I pin at least half of that on Landis All of the dialog is so stilited and the general plot is so full of holes so slow and bogged down with nonsense and incredibly hamfisted with its obtuse social commentary Will Smith is a real actor who has real acting skills he has two Emmy nominations and five Golden Globe nominations and although there are a few bad spots on his IMDB page he usually does a fine job His performance in Bright is essentially just Will Smith being Will Smith who exclusively speaks in pop culture references which raise a few questions about the world of Bright Shrek exists in a world where humans and orcs have lived together for thousands of years and curse words I guess no one wanted to make Will Smith mad so they let him make whatever stupid quips he wants but it becomes clear that no one making this film gives half a fuck As bad as the script and plot are which is a true testament to Landiss ability to punish the audience its almost possible to overlook how terrible the the CG and fight choreography are The explosions and blood spray are below Windows Movie Maker quality and big fight pieces make no sense and are incredibly lazy and confusing This movie is so stupid that it cant even follow its own rules Suspension of disbelief only works when the movie works within its own world Every 15 minutes Bright does something that either makes no sense or defies the rules it created I wont go into it much of it to not spoil anything but a big part of the movie is the hunt for and protection of a magic wand In Brights world only a bright can even hold a magic wand If any nonbright touches a wand they instantly explode There is apparently no way to know if someone is a bright or not is to grab a wand and see if you blow up or not and they make it seem like brights are rare So given this why does everyone seem to think that they are a bright and try and grab the wand One minor character even manages to and even though they dont become a burst of goo there is no way it makes sense for them to be a bright Bright makes no sense and is easily one of the worst movies I have seen From a technical stand point the camera work is fine the sets are fine the sound equipment works and was mixed properly but this is only place Bright can get any points Its stupid Its stupid and dumb and it makes no sense I usually disagree with the opinion of the media critics 95 of the time but I have to agree with them here I like lame SciFi Action and Fantasty movies I legitimately like Suicide Squad David Ayer and Will Smiths previous collaboration and I get nothing positive out of Bright Unless you are looking for a movie to trash with your friends while you are trashed stay far away from Bright it is terrible TERRIBLE Sometimes friends say just go and enjoy the movie and dont be too critical of the plot I tried that for the 2021 Bond movie it did not work So after thoroughly enjoying this movie and coming out of it on a high I was amazed to see the criticism Some of the critiques make sense the backstory is not explained and why are orcs hated if 1000 years ago it was an orc who united all to overcome the dark lord However this movie was a unique fantastic spectacle and at its heart was an orc hero who despite being ostracised was noble honest brave and lovable Will Smith was an excellent reluctant hero too The action was intense but I never felt exhausted And it was funny in the best way thanks to the virtuous innocence of the orc It worked for me and I highly recommend it Well you do get the feel that it will work as a series But you also get the feel that like all the good shows SciFi puts out Netflix will only let it run long enough for you to get involved before they cancel itso it is probably better its just a singular filmrnrnThe bad would be that at least the introduction of Will Smith in the film mirrors ID4 so much its a little unsettlingit gives the feel that Ive seen this before and that feel kind of lingers throughout the movie as it seemingly resembles other films youve thought youve seen beforebut cant exactly place at least not all the timernrnThe good news is the opening credits do the same thing and that works to brilliantly set up the films universe It gives it a very 90s gangland LA feel from the getgo with a play on race relations without mentioning actual races that is only really beaten by Marvels use of MutantsrnrnIt all makes for a very familiar movie You do feel like youve seen it before and that works both as a strength and a weakness Ultimately however it is more of a strength as the feeling that its not totally fresh actually helps you get involved in the movie It helps you so suspend your disbelief enough to fully by into the new world that magic is real at least until the credits role', NOW());

film armed only with the snippets I watched in the form of television commercials and YouTube ads The film had a very interesting look and  that really caught my attention I noticed that the film focused primarily on race which seemed like an interesting concept for a horrorpsychological thriller I also saw that Jordan Peele of Key and Peele fame was the director of the film and I was thrown completely off about what type of movie I was going to getrnrnFirst ImpressionsrnrnTo start off this film is gorgeous and this presents itself fairly early into the film Gorgeous quality gorgeous scenery gorgeous people Added with the minimal soundtrack the film seems very open Many horror movies try to go for a claustrophobic approach while Get Out uses its spacious atmosphere to bring out the unnerving fear of the unknownrnrnGoing SmoothlyrnrnOther than a few moments of How exactly is this scientifically possible you do not have to suspend your belief too often throughout the film Get Out has an easy to follow coherent story line that is aided by its pacing Honestly this is some of the best pacing have seen a modern horror film in a long time Every sequence in this film seems to take the same amount of time and keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace Every scene is refreshing and contains a new bit of information instead of lingering on unimportant details Every sequence is shot with purposernrnGetting to Know the CastrnrnThe acting in this movie is very well done The interactions between characters seemed genuine and characters reacted to situations in appropriate manners This isnt your average horror movie where the characters make stupid decisions to continue the plot it all seems very organic The characters act in a manner that you really connect with and do things that you could see yourself doing in these situationsrnrnFurther ConsiderationsrnrnAs I mentioned earlier the film was directed by Jordan Peele who has almost exclusively worked in comedy As a fan of Key and Peele skits and their major film Keanu I thought I had this film figured out before going to see it With its subject matter about race I figured this movie would be more of a joke than it was a straightup horror film And while the film is a very witty satire on race relations in America and features some very humorous dialogue and situations the film drives the horrors of racism to the furthest point The humor stems mostly from the absurdity of the films premisernrnThat EndingrnrnI do not have any major complaints about the movie It didnt drag on it mimicked reality and gave me some very uneasy feelings which is a plus for a horror film The only problem I have with the film is the ending It wraps itself up way too quickly and throws everything at you all at once Luckily the ending does resolve itself and doesnt leave any glaring loose ends The film does end a bit too abruptly for my taste and it would have been nice to see what happens afterwardsrnrnClosingrnrnI would recommend this film to anybody looking for a different horror experience It is tasteful and tame compared to other films but it certainly doesnt distract from its purpose Perhaps it was the months of hyperelatedpreamble I had before getting the chance to see _Get Out_ that caused me to be not entirely blown away by it or maybe it just doesnt resonate with me the same way it did with its audience at largernrnEither way I was still very impressed with Jordan Peeles directorial debut Its a great combination of freaky and funny as well as realist and absurdist Not to mention how wholly original

similar to the 90s style mysterythrillers Definitely must see for the 90s 80s guys It kind of looked like a black comedy but I guess thats not they had preferred Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots that freaks yet very funnyrnrnWell this is the story of an interracial romance When Chris decides to meet his girlfriends white family living outskirt of her hometown all goes as planned But he was not sure how her parents take it that hes a black Now everything has settled but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining talernrnThe casting was amazing The story was suspenseful You would feel you can predict the scenes but not that easy and when twist happens you will realise it was simple as that This is a hit film now but if it was 20 years ago surely would have gotten a cult classic status And yes it is thinking the futurernrnWhen this got out and its pre release I thought it would disappear without any trace It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast debutante director and being a low cost film I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy Thats true if you are not a film fanatic otherwise it is one of those decent films Surely not to be missed One of the best of this yearrnrn_710_ The hypnotism aspect changed the tone of the film even though something menacing was expected all along The end shriveled into routine gore and gun violence The racial implications may make some feel guilty Good enough overall but also overrated Ms Williams may be more than another NBC talent time will tell I loved this movie I cant express how happy and excited this movie made me for reasons Ill talk about herernrnMost havent seen but this is what I was talking about yesterday with my review on Brightburn on Letterboxd It was a horror movie with a good idea bad bad execution with no plot or character development to help us care about the characters Get Out is the perfect mix of horror character development and plotrnrnHorror  I was thoroughly creeped out in the beginning and it slowly built up over time which I loved It didnt go for cheap scares it built up the suspense over time that made the ending so scary I was 100 sure Chris was going to die or be mind controlled by the endrnrnCharacter development  I loved the character development in the movie and Ill tell you why It helps us care so much about these characters I really wanted Chris to be safe and I was on the edge of my seat to see him get out I loved the TSA cop and how funny he was without ruining the mood of the film I wanted to see the slaves get set free even though they ended up killing themselse And I was honestly sad to see the girlfriend turn out to be evil It just emotionally attached me to the movie and it made the movie 10x better for itrnrnPlot  I loved the plot because of the fact it surprised me and didnt give me what i expected I was expecting the movie to turn out bad for the main character but it turned out to be good I didnt see any way for Chris to escape but he did using interesting ways I didnt think of I loved the ending with the TSA Cop pulling up instead of a racist one Twists like that just made the movie fun Overall I like how it built a great story that really carried the movie An excellent film which deserves our attentionrnrnI saw this movie yesterday Ive been thinking about it for a while and yesterday I took the opportunity to do so I already had a notion that it was a very successful film and that it was successful at the box office and with specialized critics For a horror movie thats pretty good stuff For my part I think its a good film well above average Its a tense film that works well with the environment and yes it has scary moments Nominated for Best Film Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay it won an Oscar in the latter categoryrnrnThe script works mostly on the issue of more educated racism maintained and cultivated by the white elites of some North American circles where without harassing blacks they are seen as rare birds in the environment where they are Afterwards the film departs from this base to something denser and darker the protagonist begins to realize that the people in that family act strangely and that the black people who are there seem to be automatons Its worth seeing what happens nextrnrnThis film seeks in every way to escape the stigma of American terror the scares that due to the action of the effects make us jump in our seats Seeking to give us more he works a lot with the environment and the tension gradually builds up as our sympathy for the main character grows And thats the strong point of the film and what makes it different on the positive side Jordan Peele did a very competent job directing and showed that he understands horror and can give the genre a breath of fresh air And this becomes even more relevant if we consider an aspect already highlighted by many people he was a complete novice when he directed the filmrnrnRegarding the performances I think its fair to value Daniel Kaluuyas performance more than committed and tense He was really very good and if the film works so well in part it is due to this very competent actor Allison Williams also leaves a good performance I especially liked Catherine Keeners work She does a very small job appears for a short time in the film but is very impactfulrnrnDespite not being a big budget film I think I knew how to make the best use of every coin and prove that a good film doesnt really need to be expensive to make The cinematography is very good it is within the standard of current films but it does its job very well The sets and costumes dont stand out much either although we have to highlight some quality notes such as the clothes of some characters and very in particular the room where one of the characters ends up imprisoned The visual and sound effects are good and are used with intelligence and care The soundtrack does without imposing itself a competent and discreet job Man all you fans are going to be embarrassed once racism is bad again remember back in the day where we were supposed to judge people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin  That attitude is going to come back in many cases it never died and even though the faux progressives are pushing to judge people by their skin color yeah people are going to just not be racistrnrnThis is incredibly racist  It makes a few points  rnrn1 it is antimiscegenation the movie is very much against interracial relationshipsrnrn2 The movie suggests like all of his movies that all white people are not only racist but evilrnrn3 Deep down all white people want to be Black the reverse of that joke in Chasing AmyrnrnAnd it sort of rolls with that through the duration of the film the messaging is clear and what is probably why it has so much praise behind it it hits the most important political mark All white people are evil they are the source of all evil they need to be punished for itrnrnSo of course its intelligent anything that blatantly racist is going to be called intelligent today', NOW());

probably helps that John and Emily are a real couple Speaking of wich John Krasinski has Written and Directed a very clever and suspenseful horror film Ive never been more scared of corn in my life Also had jumped at water rnrnAnd the sound department specifically the Foley Artist have never shined greater in any film I have ever seen before The sound is a way flipped from most horror films as its when the music drops and everything goes quiet that the Monster attacks But not in this case everytime the Monster comes its a big momentrnrnAlthough I have nothing against a R rating In fact Im somethimes more likely to see a film because of a R rating it shows they have gus and they are willing to take a risk Fck you MPAA rnrnAnyways some times all kinds of unnecessary crap is put in a Film because they like oh yeah were rated R Although thats not always needed this Film proves a well done PG13 can still be dark and brutal Killing a Child with in the first 10ish minuets is a little dark

and Thriller Fans Although because of spoilers in this review you probably already saw it rnrnrnSo leave a comment and lets discussrnrnNo likes _No important spoilers here_rnrnIn a dystopic future the humanity has been severely smitten by strange blind creatures that feast on living flesh both human and animal In spite of being blind the creatures have a super hearing and can identify sounds from far away The creatures are nearly indestructible and very effective killers and once they hear you you are most likely deadrnrnThe movie follows a surviving family trying to keep alive in this harsh reality The movie setup is incredibly wellbuilt to transpire the precaution the constant fear and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future The sound effects are awesome and the director can successfully use the nearlyconstant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creaturesrnrnThe acting is solid and helps to immerse the watcher in the wellbuilt plotrnrnMy only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax when we are not ready to stop watching it yet It could be 30 minutes longer to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the endingrnrnOverall an awesome movie wellthought and beautifully produced in every aspect Every time a horror movie does something that Ive never seen before that gets me very excited _A Quiet Place_ is such a movie I do believe that maybe _A Quiet Place_ doesnt quite deserve the praise that it has received Not that it isnt a good movie just that said acclaims have been so high to the point that I think maybe just the fact that its original isnt enough to earn those laurelsrnrnI still am a fan of the movie hardline absolutely just maybe a little underwhelmed given the reviewsrnrn_Final rating  I liked it Would personally recommend you give it a go_ This is far and away one of the best movies I have ever watched and Ive watched a lot of movies  The story is original no  small feat these days and the acting is just outstanding  John Krasinski and Emily Blunt along with the children bring these characters to life and make us really care all without the benefit of well written dialogue  Thats not easy to do but they do it  Right from the start you find yourself drawn into the lives of these people and can feel the tension the undercurrent of threat that they live with every day  Through all they face we are also given a picture of a solid family with a dad and mom doing everything possible to care for their children the family praying together holding onto faith even under the most difficult of circumstances and that family dynamic really strengthens the entire story  Who do you rely on when all is changed  When everything goes wrong  Family  Along with the acting the direction sets just everything come together to deliver a truly scary movie that doesnt rely on flash to terrify you  Highly recommend this one  We saw it in the theater and bought it as soon as it hit the stores  Top notch work This film is terrible How this pathetic excuse for entertainment has any rating is a mystery Its an insult to art of film making and to the people who love cinema Nobody in their right mind would suggest watching this hole ridden ham acted utter nonsense themed nonstory movie to anybody Save yourself the hassle trust me its bad _Decent horror flick but the family members make too many exasperating blunders_rnrnA family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband Krasinski also directs  rnrnA Quiet Place 2018 is a wellmade horror flick that brings to mind Signs 2002 with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of AlienAliens with the extraterrestrials of War of the Worlds 2005 Theyre basically a knockoff of the monster in Cloverfield 2008 albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicksrnrnWhile this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles the constant mistakes of the family members

blog rnhttpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnEver since Jordan Peele shocked everyone with his feature directorial debut Get Out no one else questioned the potential that a wellknown comedic actor could bring to the horror genre Therefore I vividly remember discovering that John Krasinski was directing writing and starring in a lowbudget original horror flick and feeling incredibly interested to the point of considering it one of my most anticipated movies of the respective year I absolutely adore the actors memorable performance in The Office but I never really saw anything worth noting from him after that show Adding Emily Blunt Sicario Edge of Tomorrow  her slightly more famous wife  was definitely an attentiongrabbing move especially when the young actors were still unknown at the time of releasernrnWith the help of Bryan Woods and Scott Beck Krasinski developed a screenplay based on a relatively simple yet highly impactful imaginative premise Creepy scary monsters who hunt by sound isnt exactly a mindblowing story aspect but the extreme amount of tension and suspense transform a regular theater session into a nailbiting nervewracking cinematic experience Fortunately the audience at my first screening was really invested in the film which made for a truly unforgettable moment that I know some people didnt have due to disrespectful moviegoers However if theres one thing no one can take away from A Quiet Place is that it works just as well or better watching at home with the lights out in the silence of our own housernrnSome viewers might look at this movie solely as an entertaining horror film with effective jumpscares shock value and cool monsters which are all great attributes However the reason why everything works so well is indisputably due to the profoundly wellexplored family Thematically parenthood and family love are subjects that Krasinski and his team of writers deeply expand upon primarily through the fatherdaughter relationship Being a parent is seen by many as a daunting task filled with the inevitable fear of not being considered a good father or mother Lee and Regans Millicent Simmonds difficulties in understanding each other are not only remarkably relatable but their bond also contributes to some of the most emotional scenes of the moviernrnLee and Evelyn only desire to keep their children safe but when the world is packed with merciless creatures that kill if a pin drops some details like having a deaf daughter certainly dont help their mission They do however dial up the levels of tension and suspense to their maximum Krasinski shows tremendous skill as the director by delivering excruciatingly suspenseful buildups and exceptionally effective scares His ability to drastically change the entire mood of a scene offers the viewers several genuinely captivating sequences Horrorwise theres plenty to enjoy From creative atmospheric sequences to jawdropping shocking plot points A Quiet Place has something for everyonernrnIve addressed Krasinskis work as both director and writer but he also offers what I believe to be his careerbest performance in a feature film Both he and Emily Blunt perfectly capture the terrifying feeling of living in a postapocalyptic environment The protection of their children carries overwhelming despair of losing them to the visually distinct monsters and both actors shine in their roles However my personal standout is Simmonds Wonderstruck and Noah Jupe Honey Boy Ford v Ferrari Both were unknown young actors at the original release date but they steal the spotlight from the big stars Jupe proves that he has everything to become an Oscarwinner  the demand for him is exponentially rising  and Simmonds delivers one of the best performances Ive ever seen from a reallife deaf actress bringing a great deal of authenticity to her displayrnrnAll incorporate their characters seamlessly The interactions between the adult and young actors feel as realistic and honest as possible also due to the beautifully written screenplay Technically I must praise the phenomenal work done with such a low budget All the way from the shooting location to the sound department it truly feels like every single person had an essential role in the making of this movie Not even the monsters are at fault and there are a couple of closeups that could have easily been awful but the VFX artists really step up to the plate and deliver wonderfully horrific creatures Its welledited Christopher Tellefsen wellshot Charlotte Bruus Christensen and the score Marco Beltrami is employed just at the right momentsrnrnI only have one major issue with the film Storywise even though the audience is placed in a fictional world it feels so real that its hard to ignore a couple of logical questions regarding the fate of the rest of humanity These nitpicks dont really bother me but the ending of the movie still doesnt sit well with me after many viewings Without spoiling it of course the very last shot feels like a cry to Hollywood to make a sequel which I have to admit is somewhat disappointing Finally a film that doesnt belong to cinematic universes or titanic franchises focuses on telling an engaging story with characters worth investing our time on all to end in a slightly outofcharacter moment so more movies can be madernrnA Quiet Place remains emotionally impactful as well as incredibly suspenseful and tense even after multiple viewings Boasting a concept so unique yet so simple John Krasinski and his fellow cowriters create a profoundly wellexplored characterdriven horror story packed with relatable family issues and impressive performances across the board Through justified shock value and surprisingly investing nonverbal dialogues this film is one more piece of evidence that the best horror emerges from remarkable character building The popular actor also proves to be a phenomenal director generating extreme suspense quickly drastically altering the entire atmosphere of a scene seamlessly Technically it genuinely feels like a lowbudget flick where every single department has a noticeable impact on the final product but the menacing distinctlooking CGI monsters do steal the spotlight Despite a few logical issues and an ending that feels more corporate than indie my love for this movie continues intact Hopefully its sequel wont be a disappointmentrnrnRating A Works for a normal audience not for critical thinkersrnrnAlmost an 810 on a different shabbier online movie database with almost 14 hundred reviews at the point of this review written The hype is distorting the ratings of this movie like the script is distorting the physical laws of sound A creature film should not be hard to make and the producers here had the budget the special effects and the actors to do something interesting Unfortunately suspending disbelief is impossible when nothing makes sense and so many questions are left unanswered How can a pitiful monster like that overthrow mankind Where is the power coming from Not a single sound trap in the whole film Did she turn off the faucet eventually The creatures can come and go inside the shelter without breaking anything down which you would hear But the humans did not prepare silent exits in their home What even happened And there is no story The creatures come humans make some sounds they dont even fight end of movie Its like watching a boxing match with one guy weighing double the other then last round the same guy weighs only half the other How cheap and boring I want to scream the screenwriter in his moronic ear Disappointing and anticlimaticrnrn27 June 2018rnrnI am migrating my reviews from a different site which has become simply garbage TMDB looks awesome and I look forward to be a part of it Overall  A Quiet Place creates an unnerving tense and terrifying world that skillfully drags its audience into its silent fearfilled universernrnThe most extraordinary theater experience of my life The tension in the room silenced the crowd to a level requiring everyone to forgo chewing their snacks until a jump scare or rare moment of sound John Krasinskis mastery of suspense and tension was unparalleled Every second dripped with palpable fear and anxiety Krasinskis creativity shined in every moment from the concept writing creature design character development and more With decades of creature features John Krasinski offered not only something new and innovative but something that raised the standards of the genre to a new level spoilers  Many too many a

articlernhttpswwwmaketheswitchcomauarticlereviewgeminimanangleevsangleehastechnologygonetoofar If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnrnUsually I leave the technical aspects to the end of my reviews since story characters and the critical element of each genre action in action flicks comedy in comedies and so on are way more important However having in mind the whole marketing campaign surrounding Gemini Mans groundbreaking innovations Ill address them now Even after sleeping on it my experience in high frame rate still feels very  weird In case you need some explaining HFR adds a lot more detail to the image since it captures more frames per second hence making the image smoother which can be extremely distracting I always disable motion smoothing on my TV since I hate that feeling of knowing that somethings not rightrnrnIt doesnt have to do with speed which is something people are going to wrongly state regarding this film The action isnt faster dont make the mistake of saying this Since theres 25x more detail 24 FPS is the standard frame rate movements become easier to follow so theres the illusion of watching something faster than normal Truth is it just FEELS like it When characters are just talking and theres no action involved it works because it simply looks better However the action sequences are very hitandmiss Some pieces look absolutely amazing but its clear this technology needs a few more years of experience to reach its full potentialrnrnScenes featuring carmotorbike chases running or shootings are stunningly filmed but any handtohand combat is frustratingly offputting Additionally Ang Lee applies an excessive use of CGI to a lot of these moments which makes some fights look incredibly absurd HFR is not the only technical attribute people are going to discuss That young version of Will Smith  Honestly it doesnt really work for me People who complained about The Lion King 2019 not being able to show animals emoting will surely hate this attempt of replicating a young Will Smith if they dont then Joker was right society is indeed extremely hypocriticalrnrnIts just like the action sequences with HFR hitandmiss There are some genuinely mindblowing scenes with medium shots of young Will Smith and he looks 999 real In these specific shots its impossible to tell the difference between the clone and a real version However it still fails to deliver this realism throughout the entire runtime First of all young Henry barely shows any emotions except a brilliant crying moment which is obviously meant to facilitate the VFX teams work But even with his face completely still and empty of emotions the eyes just look too dolllike The eyebrows move strangely and the forehead seems oddrnrnIn the end it all comes down to forgetting that its a digital character and that almost never happens I always felt like I was watching a blend of CGI motioncapture and whatever other technology they used to try to pull this off In a few years from now if Gemini Man gets a remake or some other movie tries to do something similar I bet it will look nearperfect Right now its more of a disturbance than an achievement Put this together with the already notthatgood HFR and we get a visually striking yet distracting filmrnrnAnd if you thought the story would save it Its pretty bad Generic predictable and filled with almost offensive exposition I would have to go through my reviews but this is definitely one of the most expositionheavy screenplays of the year I lost count of the number of times a character starts ranting with the purpose of explaining something evident to another character The worst thing a screenplay can do is treat the audience like they are 5yearold children The whole plot revolves around people asking someone else what happened whats happening and whats next We already know from the trailer Will Smith is being hunted by a young version of himself a clonernrnTry to imagine how many ways you can tell someone theres an individual exactly like that person Now just lazily insert all of those sentences on a characters script and make it say them in a single scene Im sorry but its laughably bad There are no surprises It ends abruptly utterly disregarding the only interesting plot point still very predictable by not developing it any further than one sequence If it wasnt for the truly fantastic cast Will Smith is always impeccable Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong deliver great performances Gemini Man would easily be one of the absolute worst movies of the year Shoutout to Lorne Balfes score which is by far the technical aspect worthy of only complimentsrnrnAll in all Ang Lees attempt to deliver a groundbreaking film doesnt quite hit the mark Honestly its still far from it The 60 FPS HFR and the young version of Will Smith are occasionally jawdropping but both technical aspects need years of improvement to be able to work seamlessly As of now these only serve as a frustrating distraction However the biggest problem with Gemini Man is its expositionheavy screenplay which besides treating the audience like dumb people doesnt carry any sort of surprise or novelty As generic and predictable as it could be The unbelievably talented cast a spectacular score from Lorne Balfe and a few notable action sequences save this technological hitandmiss from missing its target entirelyrnrnRating C Not at all bad and pretty watchable actionthriller but also outside some of the effects and fight choreography when you can see whats going on not terribly memorable eitherrnrnAlso using 60 fps was a bit offputting especially with the daylight scenes making this look cheaper than it probably was at times feeling like youre watching something online or even on 1x fast forward Not entirely sure why Ang Lee went in that direction but didnt work for mernrnAll in all maybe worth a rental but certainly far from a best effort from both Lee and Will Smith 3255 The effects sometimes not all the time but sometimes look great But boy oh boy was this dumb And badly acted too which is surprising Like Ive seen these people before I know they are more than capable of the job what was it about _Gemini Man_ that just caused them to throw all of that out the window I assume its the fact that everything about it was completely hollow and they couldnt bee bothered putting in the effort required to Do their jobs well Bet they didnt mind that paycheque thoughrnrn_Final rating  Had some things that appeal to me but a poor finished product_ You made a person out of another person then you sent me to kill him You made a choice to do this to mernrnGemini Man is directed by Ang Lee and cowritten by David Benioff and Darren Lemke It stars Will Smith Mary Elizabeth Winstead Clive Owen and Benedict Wong Music is by Lorne Balfe and cinematography by Dione BeebernrnHenry Brogan Will Smith is an aging but elite assassin whos ready to call it quits However his plans are put on hold when he suddenly becomes the target of a mysterious operative who can seemingly predict his every move The assassin who stalks him has a very familiar feel to himrnrnLets not beat around the bush Smith and Winstead deserve a better screenplay than this The writing is weak and lazy Lee is clearly the wrong director for such a high concept action film while the action scenes are shoddy in effects In fact the storyline as trite as it is is unfairly in a constant battle against the CGI on showrnrnHowever film never sits still and refuses to let boredom take a hold The lead actors are engaging enough to hold attention throughout and even as the sugary coatings fill out the final throes we at least can acknowledge there were earnest intentions to make an existential clone thriller here But with Jerry Bruckheimer on production you can see theres a popcorn action film trying to break free of the literary treaclernrnHardly the worst clone scifier that some have called it but its not memorable either Think of it more as a time filler for the curious about the subject to hand 610 Really good watch would watch again and can recommendrnrnIf there is someone you want to put on the screen twice then I understand it being Will Smith and the rest of the cast is great  This might even have been the role that got Mary Elizabeth Winstead into the Huntress role later onrnrnI think they specifically reference it a some point in the movie but a lot of the story is Will Smith fighting himself  The action sequences are solid the scary secret spy organization is scary and secretive and there are even a few twists along the wayrnrnMy biggest problem is that this entire movie is unnecessary  If Clive Owens character wasnt basically a super villain then he could have left old Will Smith retire and no one would be the wiser  That might have possibly been a better movie though I think Star Wars might be a point against me therernrnLong short its good its great action its not world moving but does include a touch of scifi scifact were on that border  It just has a bad clash of reality that people and organizations like that exist and we pay for them Ok so it isnt going to trouble any Oscar or BAFTA juries but it is quite a watchable 2 hours of special effects and fisticuffs in the same vein as The Mechanic Will Smith still has just enough charisma to carry this off Sure it is all predictable stuff and Clive Owen still performs with all the animation of the wooden horse in Troy but the precept is interesting nonetheless',

entertainingrnrnAnd its precisely the mindblowing bonecrushing jawdropping extraordinarily long and brutally choreographed action scenes that make John Wick one of the most badass characters in the history of cinema The Academy has been looking for something new to make the Oscars more popular and the creation of new categories has been their number one idea Well nothing fits the show better than Best Stunt Work Obviously franchises like this one or Mission Impossible would become major successes at this award show These two sagas are undeniably the most important and crucial for the

my Mission Impossible  Fallout screening and while getting out of the theater a group of friends was laughing around saying something along the lines of of course that scene is fake and this moment is CGI how can you believe that Youre such a moron They were roasting one of their friends thinking he was the dumb one when he was probably the one who was laughing the hardest This definitely leaves me sad Sad that people wont realize how incredible movies like these are How they genuinely work like crazy to provide the audience with real and authentic stuntsrnrnYes its overthetop Yes CGI and visual effects are still applied but just to little details like bullets blood falls or knife throwing which never distract you And yes it requires the audience to suspend their knowledge of physics in a few particular moments But thats the thing if youre pumped to watch a third film of a franchise youre a fan You know what its about and whats its tone John Wick established itself in 2014 as a pure revenge story and an unbelievably realistic action movie the closest we will ever get to an assassin origin tale John Wick Chapter Two deeply explored the institution that governs these assassins and all of the rules that they are bound by Its a bit messier than the first one but its still a blast of entertainmentrnrnParabellum has the best of both installments It has the bestchoreographed action ever seen on a big screen and some of the most impressive camera work Ive ever witnessed In addition to this the narrative makes more sense and the characters decisions are logically or emotionally justifiable contrary to the second film The sound design is powerful and the cinematography plus the set design look stunning I would still argue that the pacing could have been better controlled The transitions between long action sequences and the respective pauses to move the plot forward arent always smooth Some comedy bits that I dont think they really belong in this saga were added and while some work just fine others really dont fit this worldrnrnBesides that I dont really have much to complain about The cast is absolutely impeccable Keanu Reeves is battling with Tom Cruise for the biggest action movie star alive While Cruise puts his life more in risk by performing especially dangerous stunts Keanu has the resiliency and agility of a beast providing us with highspeed and hardtodo fight sequences Halle Berry Sofia is one hell of a surprise I had no idea she was still capable of moving as she does in this film The stunts that she performs are crazily good Laurence Fishburne Bowery King Ian McShane Winston and Lance Reddick Charon also have their own shining moments but Sofias dogs are deadly cute and they steal the showrnrnRegarding the action stunts theyre all pretty memorable From a throwback to Chapter Twos mirror room to an astonishingly riveting chasing scene through the streets of New York everything Chad Stahelski and his talented crew throw at the audience is absolutely perfect I also love how the final act resembles the experience of playing a videogame You know when you have several levels each of them with their respective boss but the final boss is at the top of them all Its kind of like Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time when Link has to eliminate an enemy in each floor in order to move up to the next one until he reaches Ganondorf It might be the must nonsensical analogy that I have but its what my memory triggered In the end there are tons of set pieces for everyone to enjoyrnrnAll in all John Wick Chapter 3  Parabellum is everything fans of this franchise desired brutal bloody long loud and beautifullychoreographed fight sequences accompanied by a decent story that explored even more the assassins world Chad Stahelski is a master filmmaker who knows how an action movie should be filmed There are no sloppy editing or quick cuts here Only extensive onetake scenes filled with outstanding stunt work from a phenomenal cast Keanu Reeves is one of the most incredible action film stars ever and Halle Berry surprises with her physical abilities With better control of its pacing and tone and a bit less defiance of physics this could have easily been the best action movie of the century One of the best its still one hell of a taglinernrnRating A Strong contender for best John Wick movie to date And that aint faint praise Ive been strong invested in the franchise ever since it was first announced John Wick would be a playable character in _Payday 2_ Then when I actually watched that first movie Forget about it I fuckin love this guy And now here we are with a trilogy cappin _Parabellum_ Strength to strength to goddamn strengthrnrn_Final rating  Very strong appeal A personal favourite_ John wich Chapter Three  Is the best action shooting movie in 2019 Not the best of the three movies so far but still one hell of a ride and excellent fight sequences Keanu Reeves once again is in his element though emotionally not much is asked of him from his character _The franchise keeps getting better_rnrn_Igitur qui desiderat pacem praeparet bellum_rnrn Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus _De re

original _John Wick_ 2014 was something of a sleeper hit earning almost 90 million against a 20 million budget The 2017 sequel however was a bona fide blockbuster earning 171 million against a 40 million budget And now we have _John Wick Chapt__er 3  Parabellum_ which has maintained the franchises monetary trajectory earning 230 million against a 75 million budget Indeed _Parabellum_ earned more in its opening weekend in North America 57 million than the original did in its entire North American theatrical run 43 million The three films were also critical successes and have come to form the basis for the Wickiverse an expanded universe that includes the forthcoming _Chapter 4_ a spinoff prequel film _Ballerina_ a TV show _The Continental_ and two video games _John Wick Chronicles_ and _John Wick Hex_rnrnNot bad for a franchise that began life as a story about a guy getting revenge on the thugs who killed his puppyrnrnExcept of course it wasnt just a puppyrnrnWith Stahelski back in the directors chair for the third time and with a script by Kolstad Shay Hatten Chris Collins and Marc Abrams as with the previous films _Parabellum_ is built on the foundation of Sir Keanu of Reevess zenlike stoicism a quality he can deploy to make a violent swordfight look about as stressful as sleeping on silk linen with Fur Elise playing in the background and a cat gently purring on the pillow beside you And although this third entry in the franchise does flirt with a few themes amidst the mayhem honour fealty destiny its not trying to be something it isnt well aware of its own identity as a completely overthetop orgy of violence This is a world wherein even the most innocuous of items can be rendered lethal and where the endless deaths by gun knife fist dog horse motorbike sword pencil and book of 18th century Russian folklore are so excessive as to transcend any possible accusations of irresponsibility or glorification of violence In short the film leans into its status as basically a liveaction episode of _Itchy and Scratchy_ Sure it can become a little repetitive at times and theres next to no plot or character development so if you want to be reductionist you could argue that it essentially gives us more of the same except bigger louder and more elaborate But thats to ignore how aesthetically accomplished it is how funny it is how compelling it is and how unapologetically entertaining it isrnrnBeginning only moments after _Chapter 2_ and about a week after _Chapter 1_ its easy to overlook the fact that the three _John Wick_ films span two or three weeks at most _Parabellum_ opens with legendary assassin John Wick Reeves attempting to flee New York Although known as the only assassin ever to have successfully retired from the Assassins Guild Wick was pulled back in when the puppy his dead wife Helen Bridget Moynahan left him was killed by Iosef Tarasov Alfie Allen son of powerful Bratva mobster Viggo Tarasov the late great Michael Nyqvist Having killed both Tarasovs Wicks mission of vengeance ultimately led him to kill Santino DAntonio Riccardo Scamarcio the Camorra crimelord who helped Wick retire several years prior DAntonio was a newly elected member of the High Table the ruling body of the Guild the members of which are considered off limits and to make matters worse Wick killed him on the grounds of the Continental Hotel an assassins hub in which violence is strictly prohibited Declared excommunicado by the Table and with a 14 million bounty on his head Wicks friend and Continental manager Winston Ian McShane gives him one hours grace before the contract goes livernrnMeanwhile the High Table dispatch an Adjudicator an eerily calm Asia Kate Dillon to look into the unsanctioned help given to Wick by Winston Continental concierge Charon Lance Reddick and the Bowery King Laurence Fishburne the leader of a group of vagrant assassins Chiding them for helping Wick the Adjudicator gives them seven days to either resign their positions or face the consequences To lead the pursuit of Wick she hires Zero a scenestealing Mark Dacascos a highlyskilled assassin and parttime sushi chef who hates guns and is a huge fanboy of Wick With every assassin on the planet hunting him Wicks travels bring him into contact with a litany of underworld characters  theres The Director Angelica Huston a former assassin who

from the Guild Berrada Jerome Flynn the assassins Master of Coin and a member of the High Table The Elder Saïd Taghmaoui the only person above the Table and who Wick hopes may be able to clear the bounty the Tick Tock Man Jason Mantzoukas an associate of the Bowery King two of Zeros pupils Cecep Arif Rahman and Yayan Ruhian who insist on fighting with honour at all times and Ernest Boban Marjanović a towering assassin and Dante Alighieri aficionadornrnOkay first things first _Parabellum_ looks absolutely gorgeous I mean really really gorgeous _Chapter 1_ and _Chapter 2_ both looked great but _Parabellum_ is in another class altogether and is genuinely one of the best looking films Ive seen all year Part of the reason the film looks so good is the symbiosis between the various component parts of the aesthetic  the lush cinematography by Dan Laustsen _Le pacte des loups_ _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ _The Shape of Water_ the busy production design and complementary art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh _The Dark Knight Rises_ _Nightcrawler_ _Only the Brave_ and Chris Shriver _The Lovely Bones_ _The Wolf of Wall Street_ _Oceans Eight_ respectively the relatively slow editing by Evan Schiff _Everly_ _Revolt_ _Proud Mary_ and the complex sound design by Martyn Zub _Ghost in the Shell_ _Deadpool 2_ _Velvet Buzzsaw_ Everything looks and sounds amazing working in immersive harmony to ensure the action grabs the viewers attention and doesnt let go The first half of the film which takes place at night in New York and is essentially one long almost realtime scene is rainsoaked and bathed in glorious neon mainly blues greens and reds which reflect off the wetness on the road and bounce back towards their source creating a dazzling display of light When Wick nips inside a store the vibrant colours are pulled out completely with the brown of the stores walls and cabinets coming to dominate so when he heads back outside the richness of the palette really pops The Moroccan section of the film is predominately gold brown and yellow creating a sense of serenity that contrasts nicely with the hyperactive tone of the New York scenes which surround itrnrnIn terms of the action the films opening scene sets the bar insanely high  a deadly fight in a library The visceral brutality of this scene is emphasised both visually and aurally when someone gets slammed against a wall or has a hardback book driven into their skull you really feel the thump on the soundtrack whilst the closequarters nature of the combat makes for interesting shot compositions and editing rhythms as does the fact that Wick is fighting someone over a foot taller than himself The nature of the fight also leads to some inventive uses of the _mise en scène_ as the combatants are forced to improvisernrnIn this sense I was reminded very much of Gareth Evanss _The Raid_ and _The Raid 2_ the presence of Rahman and Ruhian who played villains in the first _Raid_ film cannot be a coincidence These two films effectively redefined action cinema by shunning the frenetic editing that had become the norm over the previous decade instead employing longer takes that showcased the performers physicality You know that seizureinducing scene in Pierre Morels _Taken_ 2008 when Bryan Mills Liam Neeson jumps a fence and there are literally 15 cuts in five seconds Theres none of that in _Parabellum_ with the editing altogether calmer allowing the audience to focus on the organic progression of the balletlike handtohand combat creating what can only be described as a symphony of excessive violence With Jonathan Eusebios magnificent choreography paying homage to everyone from Harold Lloyd to Buster Keaton to Andrei Tarkovsky seriously _Parabellum_ doesnt just give us rote action scenes it gives us immersive works of performance artrnrnHowever to say that the editing is rhythmic and slower than most action movies is not to say that the film is laid back It isnt and it includes any number of scenes that really shouldnt work so batshit insane are they Theres the initial library fight where books become as deadly as knives a scrap that takes place in an antique knife shop where Wick and his opponents only realise that theyre surrounded by literally hundreds of knives when they run out of ammo a horse versus motorbike gauntlet with swords on the VerrazzanoNarrows Bridge that has more than a passing resemblance to a similar scene in Jung Byunggils magisterial _Aknyeo_ 2017 an aborted confrontation in Grand Central Terminal damn girl scouts a huge todo in a Moroccan bizarre involving two people and two dogs against a legion of hired thugs an oldfashioned shootout in the Continental as Wick and Charon face down the Adjudicators team and a climactic gunfight cum sword fight in a room made entirely of glass Subtle it isnt Entertaining it most certainly is And the fact that the film can pull off such ludicrous scenes without becoming a parody of itself is as good a testament to the craft on display as anything could bernrnBoth previous _Wick_ films have been said to resemble video games in their visual design although Stahelski has stated that this wasnt a conscious decision as he has never played a video game Conscious or not _Parabellum_ is even more indebted to video games than the previous films not just in its aesthetic but in some of its narrative beats For example each fight is harder than the last ie the difficulty level is increasing with a few boss fights thrown in for good measure A scene in a stable where Wick uses a horse to take out two thugs is essentially an environmental assassination straight out of the _Hitman_ franchise and Wick dresses a lot like Agent 47 too Theres a single driving level theres always a single driving level and a noncombat level where Wick must reach his destination before dehydrating To make it to the final battle Wick must face down a platoon of heavily armoured soldiers each of whom requires multiple hits before going down whilst Wick himself has to pause at one point for a weapon upgrade Then we have a miniboss fight followed by the real boss fight against Zero The narrative is literally structured like a video game and has a similarly insane kill ratio to the previous films he killed around 80 in _Chapter 1_ about 130 in _Chapter 2_ and 94 in _Parabellum_ And this is not a criticism On the contrary part of the films charm is its resemblance to a violent hyperstylized morally questionable video game in which one must kill waves of faceless opponents à la _Doom_ 1993 _Manhunt_ 2003 or _Grand Theft Auto San Andreas_ 2004rnrnIn terms of the acting a good way to approach it is to ask who looks at a library book and thinks _I could kill someone with this_ The answer of course is John Wick And the fact that we go along with such insanity is a testament to both the film itself and Reevess performance which grounds even the most ridiculous of scenes taking everything in his stride as if its the most normal thing in the world His serene monotone delivery is also responsible for easily the funniest moment of the franchise thus far When a thug shoots one of Sofias dogs dont worry its a nonfatal hit she goes ballistic laying waste to everyone around her despite knowing that there could be serious consequences Looking at Wick she points out by way of explanationapology _he shot my dog_ To which Wick replies in that halfasleep and still stoned from the night before surferdude voice of Keanu Reeves _I get it_ That line prompted a few people to applaud at the screening I attended Of course he gets it And so do wernrnOne of the reasons the original film stood out so much was the subtle brilliance of Kolstads worldbuilding It wasnt just a movie about a former assassin being pulled back into the trade Instead Kolstad created a fascinating underworld featuring an international Assassins Guild a hotel for assassins in which violence is prohibited and even an assassins currency In _Chapter 2_ he expanded this further introducing the person who helped Wick retire the High Table as the governing body of the Guild blood markers and the Bowery King who seems to operate slightly outside the purview of the Table _Parabellum_ continues the expansion introducing the person who trained Wick the ballet school the master of coin the Elder the adjudication process excommunication and deconsecration when a hub such as the Continental is declared no longer a safe space and no longer protected by the Table The mythology has deepened with each film and the fact that it has so many religious overtones drives home the sense of oldworld ideologies being applied to people who must be ultramodern in how they conduct themselvesrnrnAre there some problems Well any film this violent is going to have immediate detractors who will oftentimes speak out against the film without actually seeing it and of course there will be cries of _Hollywood preaches against the 2nd Amendment but then makes movies celebrating the destructive power of guns_ Fair point But the thing is the movie doesnt take itself too seriously nor does it expect the audience to so the question of its irresponsibility when it comes to violence is kind of a moot point Of course its irresponsibly violent Its supposed to be irresponsibly violent Does it treat guns and knives fetishistically Yes to a certain extent it does But is it celebrating guns and violence in a realistic sociopolitical manner No not in the slightestrnrnHaving said that there is a sense in which the violence in the film does come across as meaningless insofar as it doesnt seem to have any practical ramifications for any of the main characters John Wick has literally killed over 300 people in the course of a few weeks but theres not a hint of any kind of psychological consequence Related to the disassociation that presenting violence like this can have theres the problem that simply by virtue of logistics almost all of Wicks opponents are nameless and faceless extras anonymous hordes there to be killed Indeed at one point Wick is literally pursued by two busloads of such villains a bit of metacommentary on the genre which I personally thought was hilarious The one criticism that I would definitely echo is that the structure of the narrative is a little awkward and on several occasions actions and decisions reached over the course of multiple scenes are simply undone just a couple of scenes later However this is a _John Wick_ film not a Marcel Proust novel The narrative structure is not really where your attention is supposed to bernrnGenerally speaking I dont do blockbusters I just dont like them and can rarely get anything from them I consider the medium of film to be an art form before it is entertainment and I approach every film from that perspective But attempting to parse a summer blockbuster in this manner doesnt tend to yield much in the way of interesting analysis Nevertheless every year there are one or two blockbusters that I will go to see The first such example this year is _John Wick Chapter 3  Parabellum_ And I absolutely loved it Easily the best in the franchise thus far its more ambitious more ridiculous more violent and more entertaining than its predecessors Its also funnier and the Wickiverse continues to provide a fascinating _milieu_ Sure themes such as fealty honour fate and religion come and go without much engagement But as Ive said thats not what the film is about It simply doesnt follow the rubric to which others must try to adhere  character development and motivation a wellstructured plot insightful dialogue and thematic undercurrents Instead Stahelski has crafted an action film that features extraordinary aesthetic elements and a wonderfully vibrant visual design _Parabellum_ doesnt just unapologetically revel in its excessive violence It makes art out of its excessive violence Lets make one thing perfectly clear This is a movie you watch for the action and not much less But then that not really a surprise is itrnrnThe movie takes off literally minutes after the last one ended John Wick is on the run and thats the story for most of the movie Well not entirely He does have a plan but first he has to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty on his headrnrnThis movie is all about action The movie is Rrated although I honestly do not understand why Sure theres lot of action and a lot of killing but still I wouldnt say it merits an Rrating and apparently the French ratings organisation didnt either since here in France it France it got a 12 rating That is it is only restricted for those younger than 12 yearsrnrnAnyway as I wrote above this movie is all about Keanu Reeves and action Lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons getting killed by John or some of his remaining friendsrnrnIs the story and the action realistic Hell no But it is fun to watch even though most of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers Most of the time at leastrnrnTowards the end I did think it got a bit silly The fight against Zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish It was kind of kick hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until the other guy got up again Then rinse and repeat Silly indeedrnrnAlso they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of John Wick I mean come on He gets hit by cars and walks away Not to mention the final scene were he falls something like six seven floors bounces and I mean bounces off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survivesrnrnI probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but I wont This is something as refreshing as a Hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain and nothing else Theres really no political or social preaching or any other such nonsense which is really rare today That alone gives it a few extra stars in my bookrnrnThe movie has a 77 rating on IMDb at the time of writing this which is well deserved even a bit low Even the rubbish SJW site Rotten Tomatoes claims the movie is fresh which is surprising given what I wrote abovernrnOf course there is a whole bunch of reviews that claims it is so bad and so on and so forth Some of these reviews are actually repeated several times That really pisses me off since these people seem to write reviews just to complain Its the third movie in the Franchise for Christ sake You knew what you were getting yourself into Dont watch the movie if you do not like these kind of movies Claiming there is no story is bullshit since the first one didnt really have much more story but then the concept was bit more new of course Some reviewer claimed it was the worst movie he had ever seen He cannot have seen many movies then What a load och bollocksrnrnBottom line this was two hours of great entertainment Its got the curse of the third movie this  the script has been almost totally sacrificed for the imagery which for the first 20 minutes is actually quite stunning The fight scenes seem to go on and on well beyond the point where even Arnie would have been killed Ian McShane is as wooden as usual though this time we had and missed the chance to lock him in a huge safe Laurence Fishburne brings a little gravitas to this but otherwise its just well beyond the pale sorry Part of me wants to pretend that I couldnt find the paper thin plot of the film and rag on it for a complete and total lack of story but I could follow what little of a plot there was so that would be kind of disingenuousrnrnNot only that but it would also be pretending that I didnt know what kind of movie this was when I sat down with my wife to watch it And honestly I cant stand the reviews that take a John Wick film and pretend that they expected something like Chinatown walking inrnrnYou know the ones Im talking about those reviews that lament the fact that they got a brainless action movie when they sat down to watch a brainless action moviernrnIf I said Im not that deep Id be giving them too much credit So rather than saying that Im going to say that when I sat down to watch it I didnt lie to myself and pretend it was going to be anything more than a John Wick filmrnrnWhat you have is sleek beautifully choreographed action brought to you in the most brutal of ways and delivered in a form that requires you to suspend your disbelief because it is just the right amount of totally unrealisticrnrnDoes it have a plot Yeah but not really It has just enough of a plot to make a loose story and not so much that it would get in the way of what was promised to be carnage candyrnrnAnd honestly carnage candy is the promise that the John Wick people gave us and nothing more and each installment of the franchise delivers on that promise It never ever claims that it is anything more than an action film and it never ever pretends to be anything deeperrnrnIt isnt a great film It never claims to be But it is a great action film so you have to take it for what it is John Wick Chapter 3  Parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off with Wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld The bounty is set at 14 million and Wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates come to collectrnrnWhile the plot might not be as strong as the sequel it continues the same story points seamlessly This film feels more like a continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise rather than separate semiconnected story like the first two This film is bigger than the last with vast and diverse landscapes for Wick to create havoc in The lore of world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain of command works All of the new additional characters worked well and were integrated into the story perfectlyrnrnThe action is picked up a notch creating some of the craziest sequences I have ever seen on the screen The fight inside of the knife shop was insane it left me with my mouth literally dropping to the floor It is one of my favorite action sequences in any film One thing I particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that surrounds our main character We see John Wick tested to the extremes pushing the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple assassins at a time It was really fantastic The cinematography was incredible here as well This film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump cuts The motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and seamless action sequences I have ever seenrnrnThe acting quality sees a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries Keanu Reeves is still Keanu Reeves delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward performance but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise The addition of Halle Berry and Asia Dillon were fantastic as the both added some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely Berry and Wick had some great chemistry togetherrnrnOverall this film is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown the sky is the limit for this franchisernrnScore 87rnVerdict Excellent How much smashed glass is too much smashed glass Asking for a friendrnrnemJohn Wick Chapter 3  Parabellumem is my favourite of the three films from the franchise thus far Its longer than any of the preceding two yet I found the pacing in this one to be absolutely spot on Apart from that and one or two other things it is similar to its two predecessors  and thats most definitely a major positive The look of the films are stunningrnrnThe manic fight scenes remain just as entertaining as before though I feel like here theres more creativity in using the enviroment around the characters  eg with the dogs It felt like more of the fights had a startend whereas before it seemed all rolled into one  to me anyway Not that the latter is a bad thing mindrnrnThis entry I think has my favourite scene of the entire franchise and its the near the beginning with Reeves John and Randall Duk Kims Doctor So well shot and edited made me laugh too There are many good moments in these films but thats the standout for mernrnClass again is Keanu Reeves I have nothing more to add to what Ive said previously  perfect actor for the role Elsewhere cool to have Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne again while newcomers Halle Berry Mark Dacascos and Asia Kate Dillon are all pleasing additions to the seriesrnrnThere isnt a major gap inbetween these films in my mind I gave the other two 810 ratings but this 2019 release is only narrowly ahead of the flicks from 2014 and 2017 More importantly though the franchise as a whole is great fun Bring on 4  5  and that Berry spinoff heck gimme the ema hrefhttpsletterboxdcomfilmnobody2021Nobodyaem a

Ummmm wait a minute what just happened Wheres the cool Why are all the bad guys comical and unthreatening What happened to the addictive worldbuilding nuance Nonstop action isnt a story its just a long scene You need lulls in the action for it to have impact and interest Driving at two hundred miles an hour along a neverending straight road is just boring Please let chapter four revert back to what we love about this world Another action packed movie Hes kicking a lot of butte and getting his butte kicked a lot too Good movie John Wick has everything an action movie needsrnrnThe combat scenes are masterfully choreographed without those shaky camera moves that most films of the genre love to do We also have glorious kills without having to appeal to unnecessary gorernrnThe plot of this one is a direct sequel to the previous movie  which eventually is important to the development of this trama The characters are great and wellmade mainly Sofia whom I particularly loved  the movie not only emphasizes her but her dogs either And we cannot forget Keanu Reeves that lives the protagonist and make the scenes in such an organic way  capitally at his age Dude was just born to

originalrn Chris dos SantosrnrnRead Chris full articlernhttpswwwmaketheswitchcomauarticlereviewonceuponatimeinhollywoodanothertarantinoclassic If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnrnQuentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of alltime He has undeniable talent behind the camera and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year theyre released In addition to that hes also an extraordinary screenwriter as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those fairy tale years And thats precisely what this movie is a fairy tale in Hollywood hence its title Let me just leave this here right off the bat Im not going to address any controversy surrounding this film namely the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family in general as Im always fair and impartial to the movie Im reviewing Moving on rnrnMy knowledge of the 60s isnt that good Obviously I know the whole Sharon Tate story as well as the famous Manson murders but when it comes to actual films from that decade well  Probably I only know a few by name a classic scene or a memorable soundtrack Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period and thats one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags Theres a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music references in the songs wide shots of the city as they drive by references in the buildings or even just playing an LP and dancing to it reference in the songs againrnrnI understand that these mean something but if they dont develop the character in any way then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time and theres nothing wrong with it as long as it tells a story Thats the second issue I have with the first act it takes too long to establish its characters and theres no apparent objective within the story It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination which in itself isnt a bad thing But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where its going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting the Sharon Tate event then youll bore the hell out of the audience a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something and they werent in a hurryrnrnNevertheless from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are what they do what they did and what they want with their lives then the film becomes incredibly captivating Its definitely a characterdriven story Its a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star after being on an exponentially negative path Cliff as his stunt double lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else These two are inseparable and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy even in the darkest moments OUATIH works because of its beautifullywritten charactersrnrnIf you dont care about them then you wont enjoy the film at all In addition to this if you dont know anything regarding the art of filmmaking then youll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull Its one of those movies that anyone can like However for someone who knows and understands how films are made it will always be a better time at the theater You can love this movie sure But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques youll love it even more There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I cant get to all of them so Ill just address two of my favorites The first has to be the blackandwhite flicks inside the actual film Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with overthetop performances is an absolute delight Watching those features in a 43 blackandwhite screen filled with classic sound effects and cheesy oneliners  WonderfulrnrnThe second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie the extensive onetake dialogues I mean 10 or 15minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all This is how every single film should be done Theres even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together Unfortunately thats how most features are done today Therefore from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters a 10yearold little girl to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming this one even has Rick asking his lines and the camera has to go back to its starting point everything with no cuts whatsoever  What can I ask more from a directorrnrnObviously if this is a characterdriven narrative the cast has to be genuinely compelling Leonardo DiCaprio Brad Pitt Margot Robbie  I mean do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are DiCaprio proves once again hes one of the greatest actors of alltime The ability that he has to put 200 in every single scene is unbelievable I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing solely due to the actors performance The Oscar nom is guaranteed lets see about the win Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display He has a subtle performance but its pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting apparently so little effort Margot Robbie doesnt have that much screentime but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress life could be at that time so she didnt exactly need to deliver her AgamernrnIts always good to see Al Pacino Marvin Schwarz onscreen and Im thrilled that Margaret Qualley Pussycat who I know from The Leftovers one of the most underrated TV shows of the century is finally getting some recognition Technically like I said above its close to a masterpiece Its Tarantino everyone knows what hes capable of but having in mind his most recent features its a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography Robert Richardson and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantinos features this time due to Fred Raskin The score is addictive and it carries a very significant role in the movie I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better this would be a technically perfect filmrnrnAll in all Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isnt the best Quentin Tarantinos movie but its undoubtedly one of the years best Filled with awardwinning lead performances second Oscar for DiCaprio please this characterdriven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not Its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story but from the moment its able to find its footing its an entertaining ride If you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art Tarantino delivers a nearperfect technical production Its alternate ending to reallife events is meant to be controversial but for me its a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or indeed a fairy tale  in HollywoodrnrnRating A Im not here to explain _Once Upon a Time In Hollywood_ just to enjoy itrnrn_Final rating  Very strong appeal A personal favourite_ Tarantinos revenge on the Manson psychosrnrnIn the late 60s Rick Dalton Leonardo DiCaprio a popular TV Western actor finds his career taking a downturn and tries to recover with the encouragement of his kickaxx stunt double and best friend Cliff Booth Brad Pitt Sharon Tate Margo Robbie  Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around Emile Hirsch Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background prepping to attack rnrnOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood 2019 is Quentin Tarantinos 9th full film and for me ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre It may not be as great as Pulp Fiction 1994 and Django Unchained 2012 but it places well with Inglourious Basterds 2009 Jackie Brown 1997 and The Hateful Eight 2015  rnrnA famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such Three good scenes no bad scenes While the second part of this definition is debatable with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood seeing as how the movie couldve certainly been tightened up there are some dull sequences theres no doubt that it fulfills the first part rnrnMy three favorite scenes are The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation the great Spahn Ranch episode which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace and of course the entertaining hippie attack in the final actrnrnThankfully there are numerous additional gems The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff the audacious flamethrower sequence Ricks breakdown with the precocious girl actor not actress the beautiful women throughout the great cast including several celeb cameos the entertaining soundtrack Brandi the pit bull Ricks meltdown in his trailer Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing George Spahn not remembering Cliff everything surprisingly turning out to be precisely as soandso said the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliffs nagging wife Rebecca Gayheart on the boat the way it should have turned out on that infamous night and the heartwarming closernrnThe film runs 2 hour 41 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles arearnrnGRADE A Well the last 15minutes were great the first 25 hours on the other hand was uneventful I have an interest in Hollywood more from the 1980s though so some of the slower scenes still kept my attention but theres no real plot and minimal character developmentrnrnThat said DiCaprio and Pitt both give great performances and Margot Robbie of course had her moments however I could only chuckle during the theater scene when she kicked her bare feet up Okay Quentin lol 305 When you come to the end of the line with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewellrnrnOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood is a chilled blast from the past told like a fairy tale Its both aimless and yet meaningful with the commentary on the new era in Hollywood The movie pays tribute to old Hollywood film making Sharon Tate stunt work and actors This is perhaps Tarantinos most personal and mature movie his made until the last 10 minutes which I love goes complete ape shtrnrnI cant think of any other director where the passion and love for movies is so transparent through Tarantinos craft Hes such an old school film maker that he and Martin Scorsese are the last golden age directors as every new release feels like an event In this movie Quentin presents 69 Hollywood at its peak as he remembers it from his childhood He manages to rebuild classy LA thanks to the crew and creative team rnrnBright neon lights fashionable clothes and late 60s automobiles Theres a couple of scenes where Cliff Booth Brad Pitt drives around LA and there are long shots that shows off the environment and its amazing the amount of detail and effort went into the setting  with Robert Richardson brilliant Cinematography bringing it all alive rnrnLeonardo DiCaprio was absolutely excellent as the fading Western star Rick Fking Dalton Dalton a selfcentered yet vulnerable actor that you both laugh and pity I will often forget about DiCaprio comedic chops something similar to Ryan Gosling I also like the subtle stutter thats sprinkled through out which is sad when given some thought that its something hes got to deal with Theres a heartfelt scene where Dalton tells his young costar about a book his reading and mid way through explaining the story he realises it mirrors his life and breaks down in tears with me crying with him Yep I teared up in a Tarantino movie Leo was the pulse of the moviernrnBrad Pitt was amazing as the deadpan and cool Cliff Booth This is probably my favorite performance from him Cliffs main character trait is his strength and he demonstrates it multiple times but leaves the scene before anything can escalate The chemistry between Leo and Brad was electric Pitt was the meat of the moviernrnMargot Robbie was an absolute delight portraying the late Sharon Tate Despite her slim screen time but whenever she has screen time I couldnt help but smile I instantly fell in love with her and its painfully to think something so sweet and pure could be taken away from us by brainwashed zombies who dont deserve a life just a jail cell I thought her portrayal in the movie was a beautiful tribute and how they handle her gives new life into her legacy rnrnTheres a great scene where Sharon Tate watches a movie in cinemas thats shes in but instead of Margot Robbie recreating those scenes they just show the real Sharon Tate in the movie Now people were left a bit confused over this decision although its clear to me that erasing the real Tate out of the movie would be more disrespectful to her memory so leaving her in is a touching tribute to her career and her work Robbie was the heart of the moviernrnThe other supporting cast all did terrific with the little screen time most of them had Kurt Russell makes a welcoming return as a character that I assume is Stuntman Mike from Death Proof  either way still a welcoming presence Hes also the narrator and I find it hilarious whenever he tries to pronounce Italian movie titles Al Pacino was a blast to watch as the tight and yet colorful producer Mike Moh portrayal of Bruce Lee may have sparked some controversy recently but I thought he was entertaining regardless and I dont really think it mocks his legacy at all I mean this is the same director who made a four hour movie honoring the legend Margaret Qualley was crazy good as the hippie girl whos brain washed into a cult family Its crazy to know that Damon Herriman has played Charles Manson twice in the same year and month for this movie and the TV show Mindhunter which you should totally check out by the wayrnrnJulia Butters Luke Perry Timothy Olyphant Dakota Fanning Bruce Dern and Damian Lewis  a stellar cast that did a stellar jobrnrnAfter letting the film sit for awhile theres so many memorable lines that I would often catch myself recreating just from memory after seeing it twice Theres so many great moments as well The lights of LA coming to life at the dust of dawn or the suspenseful scenes that actually got me feeling tense watching it Without spoiling anything but the Spahn Ranch scene where the Manson family stares down a defenseless Cliff Booth as he tries to speak to an old friend was terrifying  reminds me of the opening scene of Inglorious Bastards in terms of building up tension that you wait in anticipation to explodernrnStill I think this is the best representation of the Manson family Ive seen in any movieby portraying them as absolute buffoonsrnrnAnd of course with it being a Tarantino movie the music is lost treasure revived for a modern generation Always fantastic and incredibly catchy I cant think of anything better than Cliff driving around LA with the song Bring a Little Lovin playing in the backgroundrnrnOverall rating Ive seen this movie twice already and I still have a desire to watch it again This is slowly creeping up to being my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie but time will tell I guess I found this to be an excellent movie despite or partly because of major variance from the historic events it is based onrnrnUp until watching this movie I had just seen four Tarantino films so I guess I am not on his bandwagon But I really enjoyed two of them Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction I can now say I liked Once Upon a Time in Hollywood just as much as I did those two movies rnrnThe dialogue is sharp and the main characters are sympathetic enough so I cared what happened to them The film is loosely based on actual events with fictional characters thrown in and at least one major plot change that I wont give away I think some of the most negative feedback I have seen about this film were from purists who didnt like the major change in the story But I appreciated the change If I want total accuracy I would watch a documentary but I want to be entertained not depressed and I wasrnrnAnd I plan to watch it again not just for the sake of the story but because maybe the second time through I will catch more of the movie references that are supposed to inhabit Tarantinos films An entertaining movie filled with fantastic performances and gripping dialogue Although this movie is slightly directionless as I was 23rds of the way through the movie and had no idea where it was trying to take me Despite that fact I still was engaged and had a great time watching The third act is so off the walls and crazy that it makes the entire slow burn of the film worth every secondrnrnScore _88_rnVerdict _Excellent_ OK Im giving it 10 stars not because its a great film and not because its one of QTs best films but because compared to everything else out there today it is a MasterpiecernrnHowever unfortunately anyone that has seen all of QTs films the ending is spoiled from the start purely on the basis that we understand how he treats historyrnrnAnd unfortunately for SOME people it is a very slow burner but one with absolutely fantastic acting and directing Its a slow burner that is a brilliant period piece and it is a slow burner that is almost a love letter to classic Hollywood so though it takes nearly forever for any real pay off its a fine film to actually watch and one that maintains a quality of entertainment and leaves little clues peppered throughout of the coming payoffrnrnAnd the clues are important as they are essentially little promises that the film is making for the finalernrnThe finally however is so ultraviolent so overthetop that its absolutely hystericalrnrnIts not his best film but its certainly loyal to his others gone however is the quick witted and quotable dialogue that marked his earlier films but it is traded off for a sleek professionalism of a seasoned director Is everybody okay Well the fuckin hippies arent Thats for goddamn surernrnI have watched this film in the cinema when it first came out in 2019 but didnt think it was that great After my second watch 4 years and a good 550 other movies later I liked it much better rnrnOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood is essentially a love letter to cinema a fairytale filled with jokes and references and a deep supporting cast The film spends most of the time hanging out with its characters there are plenty of scenes were we can enjoy DiCaprio giving a hell of a performance or Pitt being effortlessly cool The fairytale ends in a hilarious climaxan unexpected twist in appropriate Tarantino styleand they lived happily ever afterrnrn9010', NOW());

the _mise en scène_ is so good the dialogue so sharp the acting so intense that you may as well be watching a flyonthewall documentary Its a film made of pure sweat and anxiety and its about as stressful an experience as you can have at the movies Its also superb and Id highly recommend itrnrnThe film begins in 2010 in Welo Mine Ethiopia with the discovery of an ultrarare black opal of extraordinary translucence We then cut to New York in 2012 where Howard Ratner Adam Sandler is a charismatic jeweller who lives his life on the principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul A serious gambling addict he always has at least one hustle going and he always owes somebody something Soon after we meet him its revealed that hes currently in debt to his loanshark brotherinlaw Arno the great Eric Bogosian to the tune of 100000 and Arno is having such a hard time with him that hes had to hire two Boston thugs Phil Keith Williams Richards and Nico Tommy Kominik to try to muscle Howard into paying the money back Meanwhile his jewellery business is doing well not the least reason for which is his colleague Demany Lakeith Stanfield who helps bring in highprofile clients The latest example of such is Boston Celtics basketballer Kevin Garnett a surprisingly strong performance by Garnett himself As Garnett is browsing the store its revealed that Howard has smuggled the black opal into the country for an auction the following day where he expects it will sell for up to 1 million However when Garnett sees the stone he insists he is allowed to have it as a lucky charm just for the match hes playing that night Howard is reluctant but agrees to part with it when Garnett offers to leave his AllStar ring as collateral which Howard immediately pawns for money to place a bet on Garnetts game And predictably things quickly go awryrnrnAnd all of this is to say nothing of his contemptuous wife Dinah Idina Menzel who has grown to loathe him over the years and considers their marriage a sham his naïve but kindly colleague and mistress Julia Julia Fox with whom he shares an apartment his fatherinlaw Gooey Judd Hirsch who always seems to see the best in him and his children Marcel Noa Fisher Eddie Jonathan Aranbayev and Beni Jacob Igielski none of whom have any illusions about who their father isrnrnHoward is a delusional and doomed figure about whom theres a hint of Cosmo Vittelli Ben Gazzara  the gambling addict wannabe social climber who keeps slipping on the ladders lowest rungs in John Cassavetess _The Killing of a Chinese Bookie_ 1976 However whereas Vittelli is driven to a point of despair by his own work ethic Howard is very much the product of late capitalism a man who genuinely believes despite past experience to the contrary that his big score is right around the next corner In this respect the film is a deconstruction of the concomitant globalised alienation a system capable of drawing into a single selfdelusional orbit such varied parties as exploited Ethiopian manual labourers small business owners in New York underpressure athletes loansharks and bookies  all operating with the unshakable belief that a huge win is just within their grasp Howard of course is the worst example and is essentially a fantasist whos utterly divorced from reality a man who believes completely that if people would get out of his way and let him turn that fabled corner all of his worries will disappear Its the gambling addicts fallacy  no matter how much or how often you lose the next bet will be the big winner The problem Howard faces is that he has made promises based on that fallacy  he owes money which he can only pay if his latest scheme works out _exactly_ as intended such is the precarious house of cards that is his lifernrnIn this sense the film is an especially astute study of addiction although this theme is never foregrounded  no one accuses Howard of being a gambling addict and he certainly doesnt seem to think of himself as one This is not a cautionary tale about the perils of addiction Indeed it even goes so far as to play up if not necessarily glamorise the gamblers high  the precarious sense of everything being on the line consequences be damned the sense that if one thing goes wrong everything collapses but if everything goes right However if youre paying even the slightest bit of attention you cant help but see just how hopelessly consumed Howard is by his addiction never once does he give the impression that he wants to stop gambling It has wormed its way into every facet of his life to the point where it has become his life or certainly a hugely important part of that life This is why delusion is such a major component in his psychological makeup  addiction and delusion form an evertightening feedback loop that becomes more difficult from which to escape the more selfsustaining they becomernrnIn terms of aesthetics its worth noting that two of the three writers Bronstein and Benny Safdie are also credited as the editors and this is crucial insofar as the frenetic pace of the narrative isnt achieved only by the cutting but by the script as well  this is a film written by people with at least one eye on the editing rhythms The first scenes in New York for example immediately establish the chaotic energy  Howard speaking rapidly into his mobile dialogue overlapping almost unintelligibly as multiple characters interact and talk over one another at least three things always happening each one of which would occupy our complete attention in a more conventional film Here its almost like everything is a background to everything else with nothing ever given a sustained sole focus The opening scenes establish the pace as blistering and that never really changes Its the kind of film where theres perpetual propulsive momentum  because the characters never stop moving neither does the story even if the characters never actually manage to get anywhere The score by Oneohtrix Point Never is also excellent Obviously inspired by Tangerine Dreams electronic scores for Michael Manns early films most notably _Thief_ 1981 its an unexpectedly crucial element of the film adding to the overlapping cacophony of sounds and enhancing the general sense of twitchy chaosrnrnAs for the acting everything youve heard about Sandler is true hes incredible The Safdies originally pitched him the script in 2009 but he turned it down and the project went nowhere In 2017 after the success of _Good Time_ they resurrected the film and cast Jonah Hill as Howard but when he dropped out they offered it to Sandler again And he totally and completely inhabits Howard to the extent where it no longer even seems like acting And sure hes playing the same kind of volatile delusional loser that hes played in a millionandone subpar comedies But its the tone of the performance the key in which he plays Howard that makes it stand out You could make the argument that Howard is simply Sandler dialled up to 11 and you wouldnt be wrong but the inherent tragedy of the man his selfdelusion his seemingly unquenchable optimism and belief in himself  Sandler draws these elements out every second hes onscreen finding pathos in virtually everything he does in a performance thats both subtle and broad Im no Sandler apologist but he really does have to be seen here to be believed Elsewhere Bogosian is his usual stoically intimidating self firsttime performers Williams Richards and Kominik are each as terrifying and authentic as the other Menzel manages some of the most withering looks ever captured on film and Fox another impressive debutant imbues what could have been a clichéd bimbotype role with real emotional nuancernrnAs for problems the pace of the film will certainly put some people off There are no downmoments here no scenes designed to let the audience breath This is as anxietyinducing a film as youre likely to see and that simply wont be to everyones taste Partly because of this the tone never really varies There are some comic beats Howard getting dumped naked into a car trunk during his daughters school play is particularly funny but by and large the tone is perpetually dark ominous and exhausting Which again wont be for everyone And there will of course be people who just cant get past the presence of Adam Sandler which I can understand Personally though I loved _Uncut Gems_ Its certainly not the subtlest of films nor the most thematically complex but as character studies go this is exceptionally good work from everyone involved and a genuinely unique piece of cinema This is how I winrnrnOne of the most stressful movie experiences Ive had in awhilernrnThis whole movie runs entirely on acid and how the series of events unfold was particularly stressful People constantly talking or yelling over each other while the brilliant sound work made the space around them feel so tight but incredibly claustrophobicrnrnWhile I like Good Time a little more but man what a rushrnrnAdam Sandler is absolutely terrific as the greedy and sleazy Howard Ratner If hes working with a good director a strong supporting cast and an interesting concept Sandler will thrive We follow Howard Ratner a jewelry store owner in New York with a serious gambling problem that makes the hole his standing in deeper and deeper Despite every terrible decision his character madeI still felt sorry for him I think it has to do with Sandlers devilish charm that won me over into pitting such a petty crook He isnt a loser hes a winner who doesnt win Its one of his best performance right beside Punch Drunk LovernrnBenny and Josh Safdie are such vibrant directors that can inject so much style while also having a harsh look to it which ties in with the slimy side of business The Safdie Brothers are building a solid career for themselves Darius Khondji outstanding cinematography is the glue that holds this high tension of a movie togetherrnrnI loved the score from Daniel Lopatin which will often drown out the dialogue as the retro rift comes blasting through On the other hand theres also a slow mystical vibe that Lopatin composes that gave me a surreal feeling of levitatingrnrnKevin Garnett is surprisingly really good in this movie A professional basketball player actually delivering a solid performance is almost unheard of It kinda reminds me of Tyler Perry Gone Girl in terms of your expectations from them vs what you got I also couldnt believe this is Julia Fox first acting debut because shes fantastic in the moviernrnOverall rating While Im only two movies into their filmography Safdie Brothers are upon my favorite working directorsrnrnI hope they make another movie like Good Time  Uncut Gems so it can called the LSD trilogy If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog  httpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnThe Safdie brothers are known for their anxietyinducing films and Uncut Gems follows that tradition Its definitely a movie meant to be divisive At several points during the film all a viewer wants is to yell shut up to everyone on screen The frenetic pacing the overwhelming dialogue and the loud score serve as both praise and criticism rnrnAdam Sandler gives a careerbest performance but the narrative never quite grabbed me being too repetitive and possessing a predictable yet impactful endingrnrnRating B Brothers and codirectors Josh and Benny Safdie are two of the most exciting names working in modern independent cinema so their film Uncut Gems debuted alongside a shadow of grandiose expectations The bottom line is that the film is good but far from great and Im comfortable going out on a limb and guessing those crowing the loudest about how fresh and original this movie is havent seen their far superior 2017 film Good TimernrnNew York City jeweler Howard Ratner Adam Sandler is always on the lookout for the next big score When he makes a series of high stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime Howard finds himself struggling to keep the balance between the growing list of adversaries his business his scams and his home life There isnt much to the story other than a lot of cursing and ongoing scams but theres a decent sense of suspense that carries through the majority of the filmrnrnThe most shocking thing about Uncut Gems is that it lacks depth especially when compared to Good Time Its not unfair to compare the two films as each portray a gritty side of the city with antiheros who are close to completely hitting the skids An effective crime thriller should have a lead character you can at least root for if not relate to and Howard isnt it Sandlers character is an irritating scumbag and while I guess thats what he was going for in his performance its shrill and unpleasant to spend time around this loser I didnt really care to see the end of Howards story because by the time it rolled around I was completely worn down by his repeated poor decisionsrnrnHeres what happens in the film Howard lies gets cash gambles it away extends himself gets a beating  stern warning  workplace visit from goons then lies gets cash gambles it away extends himself and gets another beat down  visit from more goons Its an exhausting repetition of watching a sleazy scumbag spiraling out of control by digging himself deeper into a hole His cycle of poor decisions is coupled with an indestructible optimism of a lifechanging big score Why should I care about somebody like thatrnrnSandler is good in the lead role but much of the praise seems to be coming from the fact that after a career in comedy films his performance is unexpected Hes a talented man but hes been even better in other smaller films like Noah Baumbachs The Meyerowitz Stories Howard is a loud crude unpleasant man to spend time with but Sandler inhabits the role as a shady jewelry dealer and degenerate gambler in a way that lends the slightest glimmer of humanity to an otherwise detestable characterrnrnThe film plays like a hardcore taxing Scorsese ripoff Its not very exciting and the tension that does exist feels forced The direction is more conventional than the material suggests but major applause to the Safdie brothers for conveying their clear vision and having the courage to stick with it Theyve started to corner the cinematic market on adapting the gritty side of New York for a modern era I dont feel the Safdies are as overrated as some other critics do but I do think this film is bloated in all the wrong ways Decent enough drama with Adam Sandler though really found his character a bit too obnoxious to really care about though the ending was well done and surprisingly thrilling but I have no problem with Sandler not getting a nod I have seen him do better work Punch Drunk Love for instance Still worth checking out even if it is a bit on the lengthier side for what it is 355 Sorry I am sure this movie had its share of good ratings but for me the movie was confusing coupled with a barrage of unnecessary profanity I have always been an Adam fan of Sandler but I couldnt get past the confusion QualityrnrnemUncut Gemsem is an absolutely thoroughly thrilling watch the plot is so chaotic and high paced that its practically impossible to not have a fun time with it The cast do terrific work typified by the tremendous Adam SandlerrnrnSandler Howard is unquestionably the star of the film he gets a lot of stick for a lot of the roles he usually plays but this is far from anything Ive seen him portray He still shows his funny side no doubt but he adds much more to make it a memorable character  which is a rarity for himrnrnLakeith Stanfield Julia Fox Kevin Garnett and Eric Bogosian are all good too The score is pretty solid also There isnt much more to note really its a crime thriller and it absolutely nails that realm Great film I never seen so much profanity in any movie Whole movie was like fck fck Fck or nga nga nga What makes this movie worst besides profanity is that its very chaotic A lot of people talking the same time which creates chaos and you as a watcher get overwhelmed Story was okay nothing special But again very overwhelming chaotic and full of profanity If director wanted to impress us with those things well I can tell him that he clearly failed Everyone can curse it doesnt need talent Profanity and chaos doesnt make a good movie Story does and good acting does which felt lacking in this movie', NOW());

movie These three films however were the result of the direction of Barry Sonnenfeld who now leaves the project and gives the direction to Felix Gray The leads Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones also do not return to their roles which makes the film basically a spinoffrnrnThe script is a breath of fresh air we abandon American soil and leave behind what we know The story is set almost entirely in Europe between London and Paris It is there that the new Agent M will train She has known about the existence of the agency since she was a child she always wanted to belong to it and now she has her chance In London she is under the guidance of her chief Agent High T and collaborates with Agent H who is considered to be the best British agent After the death of a royal from an alien planet in their care they realize that an invasion of Earth is imminent and it is up to them to prevent this threatrnrnHonestly it took me a while to form an opinion about this film On the one hand the franchise desperately needed an injection of new blood and new stuff They just couldnt insist on a soldout formula On the other hand I understand those who may feel disappointed in their expectations as familiar faces in particular Smith and Jones have disappeared from the scene After thinking a little about what I saw I came to the conclusion that the risk of cutting radically with what had been done before and presenting to the public something made with different actors was perhaps a good idea It will never please everyone especially Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones fans or those who understand that there should have been a line of continuity between all the movies but I handled it all well and I think the changes had more advantages than disadvantages Of course this might not have worked out so well if the script and characters hadnt been well conceivedrnrnIn fact the characters were wellthoughtout have strength and character and are not far behind those we already knew especially M and H The choice of actors was also happy I liked the work of Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth and the way as the film avoids the temptation to create some romantic subplot between them which would have been too cliché Sadly Emma Thompson has little to do in this film but what she does is well done Liam Neeson is an extremely skilled and competent actor and does his job very well but from the middle of the film his character is an obvious villain that is handed over to us in an overly simplistic wayrnrnTechnically the film has many qualities starting with a very good cinematography with good lighting and an intelligent and elegant use of colors The camera does a dynamic job and follows the movement especially in the action scenes The film strongly bets on a stylized look in the night scenes and on the good quality CGI that the green screen allows and that often dispenses with the use of filming on location Unfortunately and Ive felt this more than once London and Parisian environments sound too fake and artificial that is its all too evident that its all done digitally I liked the generality of the aliens and their look sometimes original and bizarre The sets and costumes are generally good and I liked the way the characters black suits were this time more individualized As for the soundtrack which inherits some previous leitmotifs it is reasonably forgettable Well this was another sequel that no one asked for at all and we can probably honestly say that this is a huge reason why it floppedrnrnI had absolutely no interest in seeing another sequel of MIB especially one without Will Smith and especially one that is genderswapped and rests closer to the reboot mark than the remake markrnrnWhich are all reasons why I didnt see it

roller coaster of emotions I wasnt expecting at all I went in anticipating outstanding performances check and solely that Since 2019 has already begun Im watching the Oscarbait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazedrnrnHowever Green Book completely took me by surprise I genuinely dont know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards It possesses such a wellwritten story filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas Its an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination without ever becoming too dark or even dull Its not more of the same its not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations Its a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notionsrnrnNevertheless this wellstructured beautifullydirected and cleverlywritten film would be just good if not for the two incredible actors who take this movie to a whole other level Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldnt mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments filled with tearful laughter or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone subtly touching delicate topics I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him but I never saw this coming His timing his expressions his Italian accent his body movements everything about his performance is perfect He absolutely nailed his part by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time and his Oscar nomination is more than fair He made a 130min feature movie feel like a short flickrnrnAli doesnt come far behind Obviously since Viggo has a funnier role to portray the audience members might feel that hes just there to help his costar shine but he does much more than that Since he brings the drama element to the story he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film However once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments Hes definitely a supporting actor but God is he a phenomenal one Linda Cardellini Dolores Vallelonga even though shes only onscreen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime also delivers a great performancernrnTony Lip and Dr Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities besides being from different races Each characters arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each others culture Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth Change in behavior mindset and preconceived ideas by sharing their own culture with another Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles with contrasting quality of life they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely rightrnrnTechnically Farrelly controls the movies pacing exceptionally well by making a twohourish film feel like half of it Remarkablybalanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes Consistentlyfilmed and welledited even though the latter has small hiccups here and there Nevertheless this isnt a film with extraordinary technical attributes nor it needs them Farrelly only needed to do ok with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result and thats exactly what he didrnrnFinally regarding the controversy surrounding this movie  See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which dont have a single thing to do with the movie itself I dont care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today let alone years ago I dont care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensens speech about racism I dont care if the family of Don Shirley doesnt like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life I dont care if the story isnt 100 true as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver while actually being a good film So please stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it especially nowadays where chaos is easy to creaternrnGreen Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end One of the best comedydramas Ive seen in a long time one of the best films of 2017 and by far the best original screenplay of the last year Peter Farrelly and his fellow cowriters delivered a seamlesslywritten story filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver awardworthy performances especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range Still the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali and he does not deserve to be forgotten I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A but guess what rnrnRating A Frequently when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s they usually

introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path offering him a twomonth lifetime opportunity We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because in real life it was nearly a year they spent together Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upperclass status he was still a victim of the convulsed

mother did However when she suffers another far more devastating loss Annies mental state becomes increasingly precarious as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealedrnrnHereditary is writerdirector Ari Asters debut feature However whats worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen who also produced _The VVitch A New England Folktale_ 2015 This is significant insofar as _Hereditary_ bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggerss film Mood tone theme pacing narrative structure shot composition all recall _The VVitch_ at times Even the plot shares some important beats most evident in the last shot which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in _The VVitch_ when Black Phillip speaks for the first time  a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera And like _The VVitch_ you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilariousrnrnIn a more generalised sense there is quite a bit to praise here For a start to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes as up until that point its a superbly realised semirealist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement Speaking of giving things away very unusually for a Hollywood film _Hereditary_s trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annies mother when in actual fact this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focusrnrnOne thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway barely visible smiling manically at Peter This is actually the second time we see the character he is also at the wake early in the movie watching Charlie approaching the coffin and again smiling unnaturally This can be easily missed if youre not paying attention and its an extremely well realised pseudoEaster egg Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvalls hysterics in Stanley Kubricks _The Shining_ 1980 Collettes ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Marc Fosters _Monsters Ball_ 2001 This is especially noticeably towards the end of the film when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by Paimon Collettes mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happeningrnrnJoshua Rothkopf in his review of the film for _Time Out_ calls it _a new generations_ Exorcist Thats a bit over the top it wont have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkins film did and its nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchezs _The Blair Witch Project_ 1999 However its very well made is creepy as hell dares to put real grief on screen and features excellent performances and thankfully only a couple of jump scares Well worth seeing Ive been meaning to watch this movie for a while now and made the mistake of watching this 12 at night while I was alone Dont do that Usually horror movies dont effect me and if they do its usually while the movie is playing But this movie has stayed with me for days now I cant get it out of my head This is not a movie for someone who wants jump scares slasher deathscreams or a movie that plays in the background You have to actually pay attention or you will be completely confused at the end There are subtle hints throughout the movie to show you where the movie is headed but there are still surprises throughout rnrnThe acting is very good I have to say though I love Toni Collette and that was one of the main reasons I watched it Spoilers Start Toni Collette and Alex Wolff do an amazing job carrying this movie After Charlies death the look on

movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the welltodo having what usually gets termed as firstworldproblems while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood It doesnt shy away or try to be subtle about it but interestingly enough we dont feel beaten over the head with it either which is a major change from the hamfisted approach taken by most filmmakers Couching this in a comedy is a good approach as well as the audiences guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideasrnrnHowever I do say its MOSTLY a comedy The third act takes a dark dark turn and the contrast not to mention general disdain and even indifference between the classes becomes much more severe This gets into some hard territory and characters that weve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves At the same time it doesnt feel unexpected almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it but arent surprised by it when it does show up This is some masterful characterizationrnrnAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor Its a smart film yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and dont spoon feed you everything which is a refreshing change from the usual headbeating most filmmakers go for At the same time they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you dont have to understand each and every one That understanding merely enriches the experience but isnt essential to itrnrnThis film has gotten some recognition and deservedly

essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I cant really write anything new Nevertheless Ill share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer but I kept delaying it underestimating my time So no Im not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars I always planned on itrnrnIn addition to that yes I also love it like most people and no Im not writing this because Im following the pack Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019s best films and its definitely cracking a spot in my Top10 I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja and Im a massive fan of Snowpiercer Therefore this isnt just another South Korean flick Its directed and cowritten by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917 Im more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture and what a film to do itrnrnIt can be described as a dark dramedy but I think social satire is more adequate The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown onscreen exclusively through visuals Theres so little exposition which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019s best screenplays The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect Throughout the runtime Bong Joon Ho leans on an actors face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions which will explain its actions later onrnrnTheres a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months Its raining and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from The gorgeous cinematography the unforgettable musical score the seamless editing Everything about this sequence is technically flawless and it carries such an emotionally powerful message Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for othersrnrnIts a movie that balances a lot of tones In ten minutes the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy and it all feels incredibly realistic Thats one of my major compliments to Parasite I never felt like it was fiction I never thought this is too much this would never occur Even in the third act where the narrative takes some bold decisions everything makes sense with what had been shown until then From shocking character actions to surprising plot points Bong and Han Jinwons screenplay is excellentrnrnEveryone in the cast is fantastic but Song Kangho is the standout in my opinion His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant Im actually surprised he wasnt nominated for Best Actor in more award shows I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me Its tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with myself includedrnrnTechnically I dont have any defects to point out Its one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws Im in love with the score I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography and the editing is perfect Whatever genre the story decides to go to its always entertaining and extremely captivating Its comedy is very smart and it made me laugh a lot of times Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory its more suspenseful and scary than most of that genres flicks nowadaysrnrnAll in all Parasite genuinely surprised me With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level my expectations were very moderate Nevertheless I love it as much or more as everyone else I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinionrating but I would never love a movie because I should or because other people do It deserves every award it received especially the ones concerning the screenplay Its one of the best original stories of the last few years and its written in such a brilliant manner with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime and the various tones are balanced seamlessly Technically flawless cinematography score editing everythings absolutely perfect Nothing is placed without purpose Not a single line of dialogue is wasted Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it He truly put his heart and soul into this and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because its in a foreign language Please dont make such an awful mistakernrnRating A Decent enough dark comedythriller with nice performances and an engaging story though not

mother Chungsook Chang Hyaejin daughter Kijeong Park Sodam and son Kiwoo Choi Wooshik reside in a tiny basement apartment with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley With all four unemployed they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant However their fortunes change when KiWoo meets Minhyuk Park Seojoon a childhood friend who is now at university Minhyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family but hes soon to leave Korea and so suggests that KiWoo take over Armed with a fake diploma created by Kijeong on Photoshop KiWoo successfully applies for the job The Park family father Dongik Lee Sunkyun mother Yeongyo Cho Yeojeong daughter Dahye Jung Jiso and son Dasong Jung Hyeonjun welcomes Kiwoo into their lavish home and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Parks current domestic staff and take their places And so hiding the fact that theyre all related Kitaek is hired as a chauffeur ChungSook as a housekeeper and Kijeong as an art therapist for Dasong However it doesnt take long before things start to go very very awry for both families in ways none of them or the audience could ever have imaginedrnrnWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and havenots is wider than ever According to inequalityorg the richest 1 of the worlds population controls 45 of global wealth At the same time adults with less than 10000 capital make up 64 of the population and control less than 1 of the wealth In 2018 Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 35 billion poorest people This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_ a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to _Hell Joseon_ sentiments wherein up to 75 of Koreans aged 1934 want to leave the country rnrnObviously enough Bongs main themes are class division and class conflict the artificiality of societal hierarchy and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place As thoroughly entertaining and funny as the film is it remains in essence an economic treatise albeit with a savagely satirical quality However make no mistake this is a satire with teeth  the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue thats about as different from the films early scenes as you could imagine Of course this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ _Memories of Murder_ 2003 _Gwoemul_ _The Host_ 2006 and _Madeo_ _Mother_ 2009 _Parasite_s engagement with class and economics however is far more overt aligning it with Bongs Englishlanguage work _Snowpiercer_ 2013 and _Okja_ 2015 Never before however has he been this caustic this acerbic but so too this compassionate this witty Indeed _Parasite_ feels like a culmination the film to which hes been building for his entire careerrnrnIn the films press notes Bong statesrnrn_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order and we have no other alternative Its not just in Korea but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored In the real world the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross The only instance is in matters of employment between classes as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each others breath In this film even though there is no malevolent intention either side the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions In todays capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye We keep them disguised and out of sight and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed_rnrnIn this manner the film works as a literalisation of the theory that coexistence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult the Kims and the Parks arent simply differentiated due to wealth rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different and largely incompatible ideologiesrnrnOne of the most deftlyhandled elements of the film is Bongs avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics  the Kims are by no means the default protagonists a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists a callous family immediately worthy of scorn Rather the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels Indeed its the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families  obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp we first meet them as theyre wandering around their apartment phones held aloft trying to pick up their neighbours WiFi signal Later as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle all four Kims start to carry themselves differently as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect rnrnThere are no heroes and villains here  Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics arent the norm in the real world For all their scheming and lying the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier As for the Parks their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance nothing more At the same time the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame to the best of my recollection we never see the four Parks together in the same shot Dahye and Dasong rarely leave their rooms Yeongyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room and Dongik is seen most regularly in his car Its a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect  this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what hes doingrnrnIts in relation to the two familys status as heroes or villains that the films title is so important Strictly speaking the Korean title _기생충_ gisaengchung means helminth rather than parasite but as a helminth is a parasitic worm the slight difference in the translation isnt a big deal In any case a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts with the Kims feeding off the Parks wealth and status However in a film where nothing is as it seems things arent that simple Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well  theyve been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of workingclass employees ie they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants And so just as the Kims feed off the Parks the Parks feed off the Kims in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship Concerning this issue in his Directors Statement Bong saysrnrn_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on coexistence or symbiosis cannot hold and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another In the midst of such a world who can point their finger at a struggling family locked in a fight for survival and call them parasites Its not that they were parasites from the start They are our neighbours friends and colleagues who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice_rnrnHowever as strong as the film is narratively and thematically it also has an aesthetic design to die for Hong Kyungpyos cinematography for example is magnificent Hong also shot Lee Changdongs superb _Beoning_ 2018 and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness gliding through the Parks house like its a fifth member of the Kim family Lee Hajuns production design is also praiseworthy with the Kims and Parks living conditions contrasted in every way the Parks live in a pristine postmodernist semiopen plan house accessible only by an electronically controlled gate and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs the Kims on the other hand live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alleyrnrnIts also in relation to production design wherein one of the films best metaphors is to be found which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is how completely Bong is in control of his craft As a film at least partly in the tradition of the upstairsdownstairs subgenre think James Ivorys _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altmans _Gosford Park_ Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socioeconomic sense On the other hand the Parks lavish home has two main stairways  one going up the other going down into the cellar As Kijeong and Kiwoo gain more access to Dasong and Dahye they start to spend most of their time upstairs Kitaek and Chungsook however along with Dongik and Yeongyo spend most of their time downstairs indicating a fissure between the adults and their children The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal with Bong shooting it like hes suddenly directing a horror film theres a thematic reason for this that I cant go into without spoilers In this way he bestows upon it an ominousness that at first makes little sense but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing Theres also a third stairway in the Park home one not revealed until late in the second act but one which has huge narrative and thematic importancernrn_Parasite_ is a masterpiece with Bong operating at the peak of his abilities never putting a foot wrong It could have been a selfserving and didactic messagemovie  a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich  but Bong is far too talented for that avoiding rhetorical cant and allowing the film to find its own space Quite unlike anything Ive ever seen it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on This is cinema as art its the best Palme dOr winner since Terrence Malicks _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costners _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990 Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series Englishlanguage adaptation which fills me with dread but no matter what happens with that project no matter how good or bad it may be here in 2020 Parasite has proven itself very much a gamechanger a film that deserves every bit of praise its received First of all its a masterpiece its shows how the higher class actually judge the lower class people At it looks like a normal story of a family who all are struggling hard to live but their life gets changed when all four of them one by one get employed in parks house After sometime we also got to see the frustration and anger of Kim family on park family because they were judged by themtheir were no unnecessarily plot twist in the film which led the film very smoothly All over its a must watch film We all live in the same country called capitalism rnrn_Final rating  Very strong appeal A personal favourite_ What starts as a seemingly simple premise quickly unfolds into much more I didnt expect an enhanced perspective into my own life but thats just what happened Parasite is a timely analysis of the everincreasing divide between rich and poor all while being witty enough to make for an exhilarating ride One of the funniest and most disturbing films Ive ever seen Probably some of the best cinematography ever 1010 Despite hearing about this from day dot I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than its title director and subsequent success Boy am I glad because its quite the ridernrnNo doubt about it emParasiteem is a high quality film It wasnt at all what I had assumed it would be like it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting  and thats a positive Yet its still pretty dark Its a great mix The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out  the ending is particularly nutsrnrnThe cast do a fantastic job especially the main quartet Song Kangho would be my personal standout I enjoyed watching him throughout Choi Wooshik is very good too as are Park Sodam and Jang Hyejin All of the onscreen talent do terrific though from Cho Yeojeong to Lee JungeunrnrnI dont have any negatives for this its a brilliant film From the cinematography to the dialogue to the locations to the humour You name it this produces it on an impressive levelrnrnNot that I need to say this given Im seemingly one of the last few who hadnt but you must watch this iParasitei is fantastic rnrnIts clever Its funny Its disturbing And yes there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story you really dont think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act rnrnIt fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director If only for the peach fuzz fight scene Loved it Its a different kind of movie from your usual run of the mill kind The twists and turns in the storyline keep you engaged Recommended', NOW());

httpsboundingintocomicscom20230406thesupermariobrosmoviereviewplungingrainbowcolorednostalgiatodeath I am not the demographic and to be honest this isnt really a film that I was ever going to like either The story is beyond simple and the gamebased animation  though expertly crafted  did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations thrill or much sense of adventure I got the feeling this was really an outing for Mario Luigi and Peach designed to satisfy the diehard fans or the children  or both but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungifest It wouldnt be fair to say this is bland  its not designed to challenge or take risks its fun for those who grew up with Mario et al in their lives and Im not going to decry that Its colourful pacy and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it FULL SPOILERFREE REVIEW  httpswwwfirstshowingnet2023reviewilluminationssupermariobrosmovieleftamesohappyrnrnThe Super Mario Bros Movie delivers everything I wanted Packed with fantastic references that will warm the hearts of those who lived and still live with Nintendo and Mario up close Along with energetic action dazzling animation and worldbuilding and iconic music  Brian Tylers score goes straight into my Spotify playlist Mario and Co marked my childhood and still today continue to offer me wonderful memories for life As a viewer clearly belonging to the target audience I couldnt have left the cinema more joyful YahoornrnRating A This and Last of Us are two recent moviesfromgames that have really impressed me Saw this in a theatre in Brooklyn really couldnt ask for a better place to do so The Super Mario Bros Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones and the characters lack depth but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit morernrnI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up but I was pleasantly surprised Chris Pratts voice as Mario is not over the top which works well It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes Jack Blacks portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the characterrnrnThe direction of the film is solid with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic The animation is stunning with the characters and world directly designed off the games but with more polish and details than ever before The lighting is beautiful with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlightsrnrnOverall The Super Mario Bros Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen While the comedy may not hit every mark the voice acting and direction make up for it I am excited to see where this film series goes nextrnrnScore 72rnVerdict Good SOOOOO FIRE I LOVEEEE MARIO PLEEASE MAKE ANOTHER I LOVE YOU MARIO 3 All my three kids used to play Super Mario Bros games and two of them played them a lot when they were younger so this movie was kind of a mustsee movie for usrnrnFor myself  this felt very much like a movie made for Super Mario Bros fans and less for the general audiencernrnThe characters the completely illogical platform jumping everywhere and the rather childish story are certain to appeal to younger people still playing the game or those that grew up with the Mario Bros gamesrnrnFor me though the movie was ranging from okayish to sometimes cringe worthy Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing Ouch my ears are still hurtingrnrnThe best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow roadrnrnThe rest of the movie was for me personally rather forgettable Not bad just not that good That said it is not really a bad movie either The rotten rating on Woke Tomatoes is entirely undeserved', NOW());

rnrnFull review here httpgeekshavegamecomarmyofthedeadreviewzacksnydersreturntozombieflesheatingform If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnhttpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnZack Snyder is far from being a consensual director Some viewers really love his work  Zack Snyders Justice League was only possible due to passionate hardcore fans  while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmakers projects Personally despite not belonging to his enormous fandom I quite enjoy his work outside of the DCEU From Dawn of the Dead to Watchmen passing through 300 I hold these films in high regard However Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life and its arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the directorrnrnUsually when people find themselves on a rough path going back to their roots helps them get back on track which is precisely what Snyder does here The zombie apocalypse genre has been around for decades but since the start of the new century audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone generic formulaic pieces of storytelling This last statement doesnt mean a few gems cant come out of it From probably the greatest zombie film ever Train to Busan to the comedy classic Zombieland there are truly great movies within the genre So where does Army of the Dead standrnrnSomewhere in the middle labeled as good fun which is all I expected from this Netflix film Let me get one thing out of the way immediately this looks sounds and feels like a Snyder movie Countless overstylized shots long slowmotion scenes an overwhelming amount of gore and blood bizarre song choices a twohourandahalf runtime for better or worst no one can complain about studio interferences this time Clearly the famous director had complete creative freedom and it shows through all of the films positives and negatives Fortunately Snyders filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre but it also works for the simple entertainmentdriven screenplayrnrnA vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an actionheavy fun uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesheating characters possess Except for a genuinely interesting storyline  though not new  concerning a specific type of zombies everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable From the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie every single cliche is present in this film Honestly none of them really annoy me unless theyre repeated to exhaustion which I dont believe Army of the Dead does that muchrnrnThe action sequences are all wellshot but I did expect more from them Most scenes are just characters randomly shooting hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal which shouldnt be too hard considering the recent action flicks Occasionally oneonone or oneonmany combats ensue and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character but then its brought down again by tiresome shootouts Snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions so its always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too muchrnrnPersonally these logical issues dont really bother me  the ridiculous third act does push my limits I admit However the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem especially when supposedly emotional heartfelt moments end up having zero impact I doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies consequently bringing tonal balance to the table Obviously not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations but it doesnt hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tensionrnrnWithout spoiling anything theres a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film The lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats Overall its an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun but I still believe it could have been a lot better Dave Bautista My Spy Avengers Endgame is the absolute standout interpreting the only fullydeveloped character of the movie Ella Purnell Wildlike Omari Hardwick Sorry to Bother You and Nora Arnezeder Origin are also quite goodrnrnFinally a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers While Im all in favor of creative freedom there must always be a compromise between both parties Snyder didnt gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason Army of the Dead is like most of his movies unnecessarily long The deleted scenes feature on Blurays doesnt exist for showoff Theres no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold and runtimes are something studios can help filmmakers nail perfectly In the end I still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewersrnrnArmy of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre delivering an entertaining actiondriven story that will please most spectators With his distinct divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained for better or worst the standout Dave Bautista and his team fight through the cliches lack of character development and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement The lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences but all are wellshot and packed with energy Exceptional production design and VFX arent enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored Overall its the definition of good fun so if your weekend has a twoandahalfhour empty slot Netflix has my endorsementrnrnRating B Great watch would watch again and can recommendrnrnProbably the worst part of this is a trend Im noticing from some movies Ive been seeing recently where they show you what could be a better movie in the moviernrnWhile this starts with a patient zero style opening they then skip past the movie I want to see to the last possible story from the opening eventrnrnThis movie does do a lot though and has a lot of moving parts at any given timernrnBatista is amazing and everyone sort of gets lost around him I cant tell if thats because hes a giant or if the movie wants it that way the cast all does a fantastic job in their rolesrnrnThe movie does a couple things that I dont typically enjoy in movies smart zombies obvious traitors and secret motivations  Its like if SHIELD was in I am Legend and Black Widow kept tripping everyone else to get a rare Pokemon cardrnrnThat said they show a fantastic amount of detail and complexity to a society that is barely explored adding a wonderful flavor to the story Army of the DEAD typical zombie action movie but its not the best thats out there Movie starts off abit boring and then goes into hyper drive midway then slows down at the end it was abit unbalanced but thats just my opinion Zach Snyder is a director I have an incredible amount of respect for He has a truly original vision he makes films unlike anyone else and he seems to relish being a bit of an outsider who somehow gets to make whatever he wants Sort of like this generations version of 90s00s Robert RodriguezrnrnYet try as I might I just cant seem to actually enjoy his films I wont bother going into it because personally Id prefer not enjoying a wacky Zach Snyder film then being mildly entertained by most mainstream fluff that seem crafted by algorithms rnrnIf you like Snyders films this one will most likely be a real joy If you dont this one wont win you over Either way I hope he gets to keep making his manic fever dreams because we need more films with authentic voices The only good thing about Zack Snyders masturbatory exercise Army of the Dead is that its comparatively shorter than his version of Justice League  but what movie isnt An hour and a half short of a fourhour movie is still too long especially considering that if everything weve seen before were edited out of the film AotD would be a short featurernrnTrue we may not have seen a heistzombie apocalypse movie but weve seen dozens of heists and dozens of zombie apocalypses and bringing the two genres together only serves to highlight the inconsistencies of each But let us start at the beginning A US military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from Area 51 The two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box the original draft of the Constitution written in the blood of the Founding Fathers Amelia Earhart long live  etc Whatever it is its highly inflammable judging by how the truck instantly turns into a huge ball of fire the moment it makes contact with a considerably smaller vehiclernrnActually it is some kind of superhuman zombie that kills a bunch of soldiers and infects two of them This entire scenario could easily have unfolded without the arbitrary and random explosion the gigantic fireball is here solely because Snyder is such an impatient director that in a 140minute film he cant wait even five minutes before blowing something to bits  the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculationrnrnOn the other hand Snyder takes his time on plot points that we all know by heart Hero is offered a job Hero turns down job Hero changes his mind and takes the job Hero assembles team And so on and so forth So as to leave no cliché unused the hero also has an estranged daughter Kate Ella Purnell this however deserves some more attentionrnrnKate works in a quarantine camp for zombies which is nothing short of a logicdefying concept It is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect transforming the victim into another zombie  and one does not quarantine a zombie one shoots a zombie in the head and moves onrnrnNow it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose depending on the requirements of the script with the time it takes for a bite to kick in but two wrongs dont make a right All things considered AotD is a ripoff that makes it a point of ripping off bad ideas  which might be all right if it were a parody but the movie is too bloated and excessive to ever be able to take itself lightly What happens when you give Zack Snyder complete creative control A crazy awesome zombie scifi action heist joyridernrnSheer insanity at its ridiculous best Zack Snyder goes all out with Army of the Dead by throwing as many plot ideas and spinoffs as he can to build his dream movie playground to play in for years at Netflix Zombies plagues zombie robots time travel multiverse and who knows what else all flash across the scene and somehow dont distract from the exciting central story Dave Bautista leads a crew of expendable mercenaries to break into a vault in the middle of a zombiefilled quarantine zone once known as Las Vegas The standout character in all this is Matthias Schweighöfers Dieter His comedy and goofiness breathe life into an otherwise wholly gritty film The nonstop action and gore will satisfy any genre fan Rather than the typical rescuing of a trapped loved one or VIP I appreciate the new purpose for battling zombies  money Zack Snyder goes full throttle and it definitely pays off I can wait to see more', NOW());

refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehashrnrnFull review httpshubpagescomentertainmentJurassicWorldDominion2022ReviewYouCantSqueezeFunFromaFossil emJurassic World Dominionem is far from perfect if just about entertaining to watch kindarnrnIm not fully convinced by it but I do think theres enough in there thats worth watching There are too many characters even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally With that said I do like em Its pleasant to see Sam Neill Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairingrnrnStill I wouldnt say any one character stands out here They all make their presence known though Im struggling to remember any great moments individually  thats due to the aforementioned surplus The rest of the cast fwiw are all fine  Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regardrnrnThe run time is overlong in my opinion I personally couldve done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldnt have felt it was missing anything The story itself isnt all that fresh as in I feel like Ive seen this sorta thing before I mean Biosyn how creative but the barrage of dinosaurcentric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly Could easily be lower thoughrnrnId love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise is there much more to tell but there aint no way AmblinUniversal are leaving this IP to collect dust lets be honest So after watching the first four movies in this franchise three of which I had seen more than once I finally watched this most recent effort There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier onesrnrnIt held some of the usual elements a child for us to care when they placed her in danger the ability of the heroes even the child to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic walking dinosaur food also known as bad guys and references to the original theme park that started it all They outdid themselves this time  keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canisterrnrnOf course there are plenty of differences also Parts of it werent even recognizable as part of the franchise They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs the ethics of genetic engineering a child clone kidnapping industrial malfeasance and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to coexist under the new planetary paradigm rnrnAnother difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the filmrnrnAn improvement is the return of characters we know well Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms unlike in the last moviernrnSo ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way Not as bad as reviews say but go in with reasonable expectationsrnrnAs the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy it unfortunately had similarities to Rise of Skywalker A lot of things were going on Some fun moments Great nostalgia with the legacy cast Lots of dino action But it also felt like they had so much going on that they ran out of time to highlight characters and make us care I will always love Jurassic Park so this movie got a little boost in rating because of nostalgia from me Wow Genetically modified locusts I hope Universal got a discount on the screenwriters On the plus side some of the effects were okay The hero shots of the two franchises Jurassic Park and Jurassic World looked good Otherwise this was a slug to get through and felt like the old guard and new guard were phoning it in I didnt like Lost Kingdom very much but at least it was entertainingly dumb 1255 Well the dinosaur special effects are quite decent Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this moviernrnI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent storyscript writer I mean come on the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen big companies are bad story with dinosaurs thrown inrnrnThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack Things more or less just happen and the heroes fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the heroes doesnt just stare like idiots at something until they are screwedrnrnIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligencernrnThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one The bad guy totally lacks charisma The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle WattsrnrnIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by todays Hollywood morons Ive been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real life like dinosaurs it was just wow But now not even the special effects can save this movie It is not a good movie plain and simple _The Jurassic Park protagonists come together in Marvels Savage Land minus KaZar_rnrnAs dinosaurs freely roam the Earth Owen  Claire Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard seek to find their kidnapped adopted daughter Isabella Sermon which takes them to Malta and then a remote dinosaur preserve in the Dolomite Mountains of northeastern Italy Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant Laura Dern and Sam Neill have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm Jeff Goldblumrn   rnJurassic World Dominion 2022 isnt great like the previous Fallen Kingdom 2018 and is arguably the least of the second trilogy There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains both of which I appreciaternrnYet I strangely never bought the characters as real people They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes Still theres certainly enough here to entertain if youre interested in a dinosauroriented scifi adventure  rnrnThe film runs 2 hours 27 minutes with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer I viewed the latter The primary shooting locations include British Columbia Malta Hawaii and the UK Pinewood StudiosrnrnGRADE BC Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie as the plot seems to be a poor choice The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story Chris Pratts character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading characterrnrnThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion especially in fastpaced scenes like the one in Malta The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing with the country portrayed as a dirty thirdworld Arabic nation covered in desert sand which is not an accurate representation of the country The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessaryrnrnOverall Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a wellplanned and executed story It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies Although the movie is not a complete disaster it falls short of being an enjoyable watch rnrnAdditionally the length of the movie seems to be excessive and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audiences attention The storys predictability adds to the monotony leaving little to surprise or engage the viewersrnrnAs if to acknowledge the franchises overreliance on gimmicks and sequels Ian Malcolms line Jurassic World Not a fan serves as a metacommentary on the movie itself It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchises recent offerings and unfortunately Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment 510 The course of the modern series of Jurassic Park films has become completely different from the old series lost in the wind and far from the path of success The story has become weak and lacks events that attract the viewer and illogical imagination has been introduced excessively which we are not used to in the old series', NOW());

adventure with twists turns and an inflated runtime that leaves the movie feeling bloated I was having a decent time in the start of the movie I enjoyed the back and forth between Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds the set pieces were great and the plot was somewhat interesting But after awhile the movie got stale as the same style jokes were recycled and the plot kept being strung along All the acting was fine in the film but by this point Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds There is no diversity in their acting every role they take on is the exact same In the beginning it was fine but too much of a good thing is not enough I found myself getting increasingly bored throughout the duration of the film and the ending was a grind to get through The

cast boasting three of the most soughtafter AListers of its day Red Notice wisely focuses on these characters giving each actor a chance to grace the screen with their unique charm The movie advances rapidly from action set piece to action set piece The moments in between are filled with Reynolds and Johnsons playful banter that is funny but not as natural as Kevin Harts chemistry with Dwayne

_Beowulf A Verse Translation_ 1999rnrnMuch like his feature debut the excellent _Hereditary_ 2018 writerdirector Ari Asters _Midsommar_ has divided audiences much more than critics Whereas _Hereditary_ had an 89 critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 82610 it managed only a 65 audience approval rating with an average score of 3435 whilst also famously garnering a pitiful D CinemaScore _Midsommar_ currently has an 82 critical approval with a 75110 average against a 61 audience approval with a 3365 average and a C CinemaScore This recalls recent films such as Robert Eggerss _The VVitch A New England Folktale_ 90 with a 77710 average vs 58 with a 3225 average and a C CinemaScore and Trey Edward Shultss superb _It Comes At Night_ 87 with a 73610 average vs 44 with a 2755 average and a D CinemaScore The reason for the discrepancies In large part its because all four films were promoted as something they werent drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didnt get what they were expecting all four were heavily promoted as horrors when none in fact are and in the case of _It Comes At Night_ not even remotely close As for _Midsommar_ it is at best a thriller and I would argue that even thats pushing it Whereas _Hereditary_ was a study of grief and familial breakdown it undeniably had horror elements the floating selfdecapitation scene is one of the most haunting images put on screen in decades In the case of _Midsommar_ however apart from one very brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody elses skin dont ask theres nothing remotely resembling a horror trope and very little thats thrilling Which is not necessarily a criticism I enjoyed the film very much I simply think the marketing people have once again set the movie up to fail with a lot of the people who will see itrnrnWhat _Midsommar_ does have in abundance however is dread which is of course very different to horror More unsettling than frightening as with _Hereditary_ _Midsommar_ is primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes  both films begin with paralysing tragedies that almost cripple the protagonist with the subsequent narrative analysing the psychological reaction to such tragedies by way of various spooky goingson And whereas _Hereditary_ dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off deep emotional pain _Midsommar_ is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isnt exactly sympathetic to ones situation Aster himself has called it a _breakup movie_ and its hard to argue against this categorisation as the story begins and ends with very specific relationship drama And whilst the characters are grossly underwritten and the film is painfully predictable if youre familiar with Robin Hardys _The Wicker Man_ 1973 chances are that everything you think is going to happen in _Midsommar_ does happen its beautifully crafted brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight and vastly ambitious in scope it runs 147 minutes Indeed its the type of film where you can tell the director was given an unusual amount of freedom to fulfil their vision And whilst that can often result in unmitigated disaster think filmmakers such as Michael Cimino Richard Kelly and David Robert Mitchell much like Jordan Peeles _Us_ 2019 _Midsommar_ avoids the dreaded sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the parkrnrnThe film begins as Dani Ardor a superb Florence Pugh is hit with the kind of tragedy from which many would find it impossible to recover  her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths the incident sends Dani spiralling into despair turning for support to her boyfriend Christian Jack Reynor an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD thesis Unfortunately for some time Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani as he finds her overly needy and he had been trying to work up to ending the relationship when her family died The following summer Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh William Jackson Harper and Mark Will Poulter have been invited by Swedish student Pelle Vilhelm Blomgren to his ancestral pagan commune in Hårga where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place with Josh planning to write his PhD thesis on the festival and Mark planning to have sex with as many Swedish girls as he can Dani is upset that Christian didnt tell her about the trip and to placate her he invites her to come never imagining she will say yes But she does much to Marks disgust and so the foursome accompany Pelle to Sweden meeting the disturbingly polite and welcoming members of the commune as well as English students Connie Ellora Torchia and Simon Archie Madekwe who were invited by Pelles brother Ingemar Hampus Hallberg It doesnt take long however for the visitors to learn that things arent exactly kosher in the commune  whether its the elderly couple who fling themselves from the top of a cliff the pies with pubic hair in them the oracle child specifically bred through incest the caged bear who seems to have no function in the festival the strange yellow pyramid building which they are forbidden from entering the elaborate murals depicting violence and torture or the communal wailingrnrn_Midsommar_ originally began life as a slasher movie set in a Swedish commune until Aster revised the script to focus on a toxic relationship after going through a particularly bad breakup himself Christian is your garden variety manipulator who uses Danis emotional vulnerability against her For example in a brilliantly written early scene after she has learned about the trip shes understandably upset that he didnt tell her about it but in the space of just a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to _him_ The core of the story is Dani slowly coming to realise that Christian isnt the man she thought he was and in a weird way its a variation on the female revenge genre However whereas usually its revenge for rape or assault here its revenge for being a complete and utter dick In this sense the film is primarily an allegory for the process of a young womans emotionalspiritual awakening independent of the man on whom she thought she had to rely Indeed one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic Danis surname is Ardor but she is denied love and passion and in the paganism of the commune shes offered something she cant get from a selfserving Christianity Whether _Midsommar_ works for you or not will depend largely on how you respond to this element of the story  if you buy into the notion that Christian is the _de facto_ villain and that Dani is an emotionally scarred young woman looking for support youll get a lot more out of it than if you think Dani is a needy whinger and Christian would do well to be rid of herrnrnAesthetically the film looks terrific with Henrik Svenssons production designer Andrea Fleschs costume designer and Pawel Pogorzelskis cinematography especially praiseworthy Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes once the film shifts to Sweden the visual design changes completely The production design emphasises an openplan vastness with unlimited space to move but few places to hide the cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight which again makes it hard to hide and the costume design focuses on brilliant white with a smattering of colour Unlike the vast majority of horror movies there are few shadows or dark corners but the film is shot in such a way that the very lack of such is itself disconcerting The same is true for the always pristine costumes which suggest that something is just not quite right underneath the veneer of cleanliness and insincere sense of perfection Indeed the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive the long middle act doesnt really feature much in the way of narrative incident but it sure does a fine job of creating a _milieu_ that feels completely authentic and livedinrnrnThere are also some nice individual moments For example the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity that will play out throughout Danis hysterical crying upon learning of her familys deaths blends seamlessly with Bobby Krlics wonderfully discordant music a superb singletake shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle the camera follows the car by turning downwards ending up upsidedown signalling to the viewer that things have changed irrevocably for the characters as if they have crossed a barrier of some kindrnrnIn terms of the narrative design somewhat unusually the film wears its predictability on its sleeve with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune  the _dénouement_ isnt simply hinted at its allbut presented to us from the outset With that in mind anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens Even if youre only familiar with _The Wicker Man_ youll still be able to take a decent stab at how things are going to turn out Of course this allows the audience to roundly mock the characters utter obliviousness to whats coming which is presumably the point You know that scene in most horror films where you think to yourself how can they not realise something nasty is going to happen _Midsommar_ is like a 147minute version of that one scenernrnAs for the acting much as _Hereditary_ was Toni Collettes _Midsommar_ belongs entirely to Florence Pugh whos going from strengthtostrength at the moment For most of the film shes on the precipice of a nervous breakdown with her performance redolent of Shelley Duval in Stanley Kubricks _The Shining_ 1980 Pugh has already impressed in films as varied as Carol Morleys _The Falling_ 2014 William Oldroyds _Lady Macbeth_ 2016 Richard Eyres _King Lear_ 2018 and Stephen Merchants _Fighting With My Family_ 2019 but _Midsommar_ is easily her best and most layered performance thus far especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the batshit insane last 20 minutes Elsewhere the performances are all fine but the actors arent helped by the script As Christian Jack Reynor plays well Jack Reynor Theres nothing really wrong with the performance although he is the least convincing academic ever put on screen and he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passiveaggressive persona but there isnt a huge amount of depth The same is true of Will Poulter who plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sexcrazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies and who is never characterised beyond this caricature As Josh William Jackson Harper although a far more believable academic than Reynor barely registers whilst Vilhelm Blomgrens Pelle is so onenote and obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking pointrnrnAs this might suggest one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters This is especially true of Christian a boyfriend so selfish and uncaring one wonders how he ever wooed Dani in the first place Additionally their relationship is demarcated along painfully stereotypical lines  the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys than comforting his girlfriend Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle the film pushes the suspension of disbelief too far There are multiple moments when the goingson in the commune should prompt the visitors to leave immediately but apart from a few weak attempts by Dani to persuade the others to go they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations Indeed in a lot of ways theyre no different from the horny idiots who get picked off one by one in so many cheap slasher films Furthermore it doesnt help that initially Josh is depicted as an expert on paganism and is familiar with many aspects of the festival but later on the script conveniently forgets about this when necessaryrnrnThematically things are also quite jumbled Whilst the core theme of a toxic relationship is present to one degree or another throughout and Aster actually has some interesting things to say about complicity in such relationships a lot of other ideas are thrown into the mix without really going anywhere  death renewal paganism itself the nature of grief and given the strong opening that Aster allows this theme to drop off is especially disappointing Additionally as already mentioned there are few surprises here Aster is obviously a big fan of the subgenre of folk horror but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede any kind of narrative inventiveness leading to predictability and as insane as the last 20 minutes are nothing really happens that surprised me Also as in _Hereditary_ the explanation for whats going on isnt anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it making explicit something which was so deeply unsettling when implicitrnrnThat all said however I did enjoy _Midsommar_ Not as disturbing as _Herditary_ it finds Aster again working with dread rather than quintessential horror tropes Aesthetically impressive and built on a terrific central performance it could be accused of style over substance or cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities but ultimately Asters mastery of tone sees him through The script could use some work no doubt but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled with the most mundane of objects imbued with haunting portentousness The _dénouement_ is more rote than I expected and although Aster tries to tackle too many issues his depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama Unnerving and audacious _Midsommar_ is ultimately an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnrnThis was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018 so obviously Ari Asters second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement Fortunately even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country I was able to stay away from spoilers as well as from any sort of images or clips As you might expect this is not a typical horror movie even though its being marketed as belonging to the genre Sure it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre but it definitely doesnt play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at nightrnrnHereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive First of all it drags Theres no denying it The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in which in a 140minute runtime is a bit too far ahead Granted its one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight Ive ever seen but its buildup extremely welldone takes a big part of the second act slowing down the pacing too muchrnrnAdditionally its a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear If you didnt enjoy Asters first feature because it didnt have enough scary sequences Midsommar isnt going to convert you to being a fan of his work Similarly to Ad Astra just released last week its a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained then you might want to think again I cant stress this enough you need to pay attention to what youre watchingrnrnHints to what the story holds for us are everywhere especially in the walls Through paintings runes and handdrawings Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going Its a film about two key themes how to deal with grief and how to handle a complicated relationship These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how theyre being developed I love how Aster addresses the latter topic he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own but Im disappointed by the way he put the former into the backgroundrnrnThe first 1520 minutes deal with what happens to Danis life and its never approached again even though theres a vague idea of what could have actually happened by the end of the movie Regarding the other point it isnt exactly a toxic relationship that weve seen in previous films but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other Hence some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something Its a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through Technically this is one of 2019s most fascinating productionsrnrnFrom the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing from the stunningly impressive production design again the WALLS to the immersive score  Ari Aster is no joke The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all just raw and powerful emotions Its her careerbest performance no doubt about it Her characters storyline is partially what brings the horror to the narrative Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season as well as the movies technical achievements since the horror genre still didnt convince enough people to give a shotrnrnRegarding the other characters theyre my main issue They simply felt like plot devices Will Poulter Mark is funny as the comicrelief guy but his character like every other one besides Dani doesnt do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots if there are any They barely have any backstory and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind There are incredibly shocking bloody and jawdropping scenes some might make you feel uncomfortable others might make you laugh But theyre all meant to shock you in some shape or formrnrnWhether you love it or hate it Midsommar is memorable If you didnt enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares the former isnt for you then Midsommar requires full attention patience and an openminded mentality Its not a generic horror flick so dont go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares Expectations are everything so moderate them in the best way possible It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS youll be able to maybe follow the story a bit betterrnrnTechnically Ari Aster delivers a masterful work with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography plus seamless editing Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance but her supporting cast didnt do much with their underdeveloped characters The film drags a lot and it can become tedious at some point but in the end its one of those movies that sticks with you A second viewing may be necessary and it will probably be a better experience Cant wait to find out Go see itrnrnRating B _Midsommar_ might genuinely be my big disappointment for 2019 Im not saying its bad But coming into this on the back of not only the crazy good _Hereditary_ from last year but also the gushing praise from the online horror community I guess my expectations were a little high It doesnt make me feel good to say it but honestly Im glad I didnt see this in the cinema Firstly because I think I mightve been a little mad if I had forked out 25 to see this based on the experience I ended up happening but also secondly because I dont much feel like going blind in the theatre from the sheer white exposure that takes up 97 of _Midsommars_ runtimernrn_Final rating½  Had a lot that appealed to me didnt quite work as a whole_ An impressive work Midsommar is Ari Asters followup to Herditary a decent if flawed horror filmrnrnMidsommar follows Dani who after the tragic loss of her parents and sister decides to follow her increasingly distant boyfriend and his friends on a trip to Sweden to visit the pagan cult commune their roommate Pelle grew up in While seemingly open and friendly it becomes obvious fairly quickly that something else is going on here The obvious comparisons to The Wicker Man are not uncalled forrnrnFirst in the interest of full disclosure this review is based on the nearly threehour Directors Cut of the film rather than the theatrical release I havent even seen the theatrical release so I cant attest as to what was added in the nearly 30 new minutes I will say that the Directors Cut is pretty seamless and doesnt seem to have any superfluous scenesrnrnSecond we need to start with the elephant in the room and address how this compares to Hereditary which as I stated was okay but flawed The major flaw in that film is that it has its own internal consistency but doesnt have consistency from an audience standpoint Theres only the most minor of hints as to the truth and its clear that in that world such things were possible but the audience isnt really let in on the answer until the end The audience has to think about it to get that internal logic Im usually the type that doesnt like spoonfeeding information to the audience but this withheld a little too muchrnrnOkay that was Hereditary So how does Midsommar compare Well its far better in terms of letting the audience in on the secret and revealing its internal logic But sometimes its too good at it Theres not much of a secret You know whats ultimately comingrnrnHowever interestingly this is where the brilliance of the movie actually comes in Much like life and sex its about the journey not the destination We know where were going but the fun is in seeing how we get there And its a fun and colorful journey This is bright daytime horror taking place in Sweden at Midsommar when there is very little darkness at night which itself could be a metaphor in that we can see the end and know where were goingrnrnSo why only 4 stars The film is great but definitely not perfect and has a couple deep flaws I could give the film a little more credit if it did conceal the end a little more giving a less obvious twist The other is that it sticks pretty close to traditional character archetypes for horror films If you dont know what I mean this was very well addressed in Cabin in the Woods A little more variety and a little added creativity could have elevated Midsommars score While its still great dont expect a perfect film _The Wicker Man meets The Village_rnrnInvited by their genial Swedish friend four college students from New York take a vacation to rural Sweden to experience a Midsummer celebration at a commune A couple of them are cultural anthropology students who are naturally interested in the friendly isolated group and their odd ceremonies The situation goes from friendly and curious to shocking Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play the American protagonistsrnrnMidsommar 2019 is folk horror that plays out like The Wicker Man 19732006 meets The Village 2004 with elements of The Lords of Salem 2012 The topic of visiting a secluded pagan religious community and the increasing challenges thereof can be seen in other flicks like Ogre 2008 The Ritual 2017 and Apostle 2018 as well as the recent Indie Devils Island 2021 rnrnIf you like these kinds of movies Midsommar delivers the goods  Writerdirector Ari Aster did his homework combining fact with fiction old and new Theres an insightful comparison between the lack of social intimacy in modern Western culture and the familylike camaraderie of the remote Commune Pugh makes for an effective protagonist and theres some convincing gore Its a professionally made piece no doubt  rnrnUnfortunately the first half is more compelling than the second which devolves into tedious ceremonies and the corresponding gobbledygook Hammers The Mummy 1959 had the same issue but was mercifully an hour shorter Midsommar needed tightened up for a more gripping viewing experience but directors generally dont like to cut scenes from their baby rnrnThe film runs 2 hours 27 minutes and was shot in Budakeszi Hungary Hårga as well as Korda Studios Etyek and Budapest Hungary Danis apartment was shot in Brooklyn New YorkrnrnGRADE B Hey honey  lets take a trip to a surreal drugfuelled Swedish festival with cruel pagan tendencies Yes I know  it all sounds too bonkers and yes for the main it is I think you have to be in the zone if you are going to get anything from this otherwise it could fairly be described as nonsense There are shades of The Wicker Man here but this is nowhere near as well written or as scary Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor try their best but this just doesnt really work On the plus side  it is beautifully shot  the purity of the light is amazing This place raises more red flags than Summerisle an overlong film and the characters are as thick as pigsht I was so hoping the finale would deliver the goods but it ended up as a less memorable The Wicker ManrnrnBut but but I do admire it Of course creators of this movie are big fans of the wicker man movieexcellent 60s movie Very slow action Didnt got bored but in the end not fully satisficed Not what it appears to be I really did notsee this comingrnrnThis is one of those horror movies that is actually really deep and symbolical and works on multiple levels and has multiple stories hidden within the surface narrative and in this case its actually 3 stories that are told at the same time though only the surface narrative is picked up consciously the other 2 are picked up subconsciously and thats what makes it disturbingrnrnBe sure to watch the extended cut because only there does it really become apparent what the other 2 stories are about So here go the spoilers cause now I am gonna say what I believe those 3 themes are Obviously on the surface its a horror movie but beneath that its a drama about relationships and about breaking up  some people pick up on that first hidden themenarrative and so they find it boring because they expected a horror movie but what they get is an emotional dramarnrnBut no one has consciously picked up on the 3rd narrative  or at least I have never seen anyone mention it  even though its very obvious when you watch the extended cut The third genre of movies is that its a movie about the 3rd Reich and related National Socialist propaganda ideology and atrocities committed and thats the aspect everyone only picks up subconsciously and that makes everyone feel uncomfortable watching this movie but without really knowing whyrnrnWhich also explains some of the criticism such as Swedes and Pagans complaining that their culture and ideology isnt portrayed accurately Of course it isnt because thats not the culture or ideology its trying to portray So the 4th and ultimate genre is that its really a biting political satire that uses all the other genres as coverrnrnIts like the travel movies that the Soviet Union published that make the Soviet Union look like some kind of socialist Disneyland And as long as you were a tourist who was willing to only go to the places he was told to go and to just gloss over all the labor camps and atrocities it kinda was And so what those movies were for socialism this movie is for National Socialism  a sorta satirical video travel guide into a promised National Socialist fantasy land and Utopian paradise that never existed and that only a complete psychopath could ever try to propagate as something desirable', NOW());

dad was born in 1933 and in all the years that came afterwards  even when he himself joined the RAF  his father never spoke about those yearsrnrnThe Great War broke men in ways the likes of which had never been seen before and perhaps have never been seen since It exposed men to psychological horrors inconceivable to most people today The nature of trench warfare and the concomitant use of artillery on a scale beyond anything in human history did such things to mens minds that even thousands of those who returned never really left the battlefields Weve all seen Shell shocked soldier 1916 one of the most haunting photographs ever taken and the picture it paints is a disturbingly vivid one But what makes the Great War the socalled war to end all wars so much worse than it had to be was that it pitted old school tactics against modern weaponry Generals on both sides believed the war could be won as others had been by sending wave after wave of men over the top in an attempt to overwhelm enemy positions However such tactics failed to take into account advancements in weaponry with combatants defending their trenches with miles of machinegun emplacements and fields of landmines reinforced with the wars most successful killer  endless artillery barrages The technology had advanced The tactics had not Which led to the ninemonth stalemate of the Battle of Verdun February 21 to December 18 1916 during which the Germans lost 143000 men and the French lost 163000 Which led to the first day of the Somme July 1 1916 when the British suffered nearly 20000 loses in less than 12 hours Which led to the unimaginable slaughter of the hellcometoEarth that was the Third Battle of Ypres better known today as Passchendaele July 31 to November 10 1917 where at least 400000 men died maybe as many as twice thatrnrnEvery soul who fought in those battles is gone now The last surviving combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Claude Choules who joined the Royal Navy in 1915 aged just 14 died at the age of 110 in 2011 And unlike conflicts such as World War II or Vietnam The Great War has largely dropped from the popular consciousness Not just the reasons why it was fought but the conditions in which it was fought Even celebrated films such as Lewis Milestones _All Quiet on the Western Front_ 1930 or Stanley Kubricks _Paths of Glory_ 1957 arent all that well known And thats one of the reasons that films like 1917 are important  they ensure we dont forgetrnrnWritten by Sam Mendes and Krysty WilsonCairns _1917_ is very loosely based on stories told to Mendes by his grandfather Alfred Hubert Mendes who was a front line messenger during the war and who at 54 was able to use the lowlying No Mans Land mist as cover without having to stoop or crawl and thus was much faster compared to other messengers The film is directed by Mendes _American Beauty_ _Revolutionary Road_ _Skyfall_ and unless youve been living under a rock youll know that its done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two single shots the marketing material says one shot but its two  theres a cuttoblack timejump about midway through the film where no attempt is made to hide the transition In reality of course there are a lot more than two shots the longest single shot was just over 8 minutes but the edits have been digitally hidden much like Alejandro González Iñárritus _Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance_ 2014 or Erik Poppes _Utøya 22 Juli_ 2018 Working with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins _Kundun_ _No Country for Old Men_ _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford_ _The Reader_ _Blade Runner 2049_ Mendes wanted the film to be the most immersive war movie ever put on screen with the story designed to take place in realtime so as to ensure the importancerelevance of the singleshot aesthetic And although I have some issues with it and I certainly dont think its the greatest war movie ever made by and large I think Mendes has made an exceptional film one in which form and content are unusually tightly matched with the style extremely effective at delivering the story in a thematically justified mannerrnrnApril 6 1917 the Western Front Two young British Lance Corporals Will Schofield George MacKay a veteran of the Somme and the younger more idealistic Tom Blake DeanCharles Chapman are summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore Colin Firth Recently German forces have fallen back and Colonel Mackenzie Benedict Cumberbatch of the 2nd Battalion Devonshire Regiment believes that if he attacks now he will break the line and turn the tide of the war However hes unaware that the retreat is a tactical gambit  the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait With communication lines cut Schofield and Blake who has a brother in the 2nd are given a simple but dangerous mission  to physically carry an order from Erinmore to Mackenzie calling off the following mornings attack a mission which will involve them crossing into No Mans Land and traversing the Germans former position If they fail 1600 soldiers will be slaughtered Mackenzie is six miles away They have ten hoursrnrnSo the films big selling point is its aesthetic design The use of the singleshot format is such a noticeable and idiosyncratic type of form that whenever its used it automatically places pressure on the content which must justify why the film is shot this way why it would lose something inherently thematic if shot conventionally If the content cant do that in other words if the content cant justify the form the form becomes gimmicky drawing attention to itself Think of for example Alfred Hitchcocks _Rope_ 1948 which was edited to look like one shot or Sebastian Schippers _Victoria_ 2015 which was legitimately one shot Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design  shoot them conventionally and theyre still broadly the same film thematically Compare this with genuine oneshot films such as Mike Figgiss _Timecode_ 2000 or Alexander Sokurovs _Russkij Kovcheg_ 2002 and edited oneshot films such as Gustavo Hernándezs _La casa muda_ 2010 or the aforementioned _Utøya 22 Juli_ Whether its the spiralling nature of events in _Timecode_ the elegant causeandeffect historical sweep of _Russkij Kovcheg_ or the realtime pressure and escalation of _La casa muda_ and _Utøya 22 Juli_ these films tie form to content in such a way that they become indistinguishable  form _is_ content content _is_ form And I think Mendes achieves like synergyrnrnIs the oneshot effect distracting At first yes it is a little especially if youre playing the game of trying to spot where editor Lee Smith _Master and Commander The Far Side of the World_ _Elysium_ _Interstellar_ has hidden the transitions But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes I stopped looking because I realised I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily In essence once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms you forget about trying to spot the edits and asking yourself _how did they do that_ instead of letting the cinematography do exactly what its supposed to do  immerse you This is a film that wants to try to convey what it was like to live and fight in those trenches with Mendes stating _I wanted people to understand how difficult it was for these men And the nature of that is behind everything_ And it does about as good a job as any war film I can think of in evoking the psychical reality if not necessarily the psychological more on that in a momentrnrnGenerally speaking the majority of the film is shot in one of two ways  either the camera is behind Schofield and Blake following their path or its in front of them facing back towards them as they follow its path There are some minor deviations from this a few drone shots some sideon footage etc but irrespective of that the film never for one second leaves their presence And because the two men are almost perpetually in motion it means that the camera is almost perpetually in motion lending not only a tremendous fluidity to the blocking framing and movement but so too a natural motivation  if theyre walking along a trench were walking along a trench if theyre moving stealthily through a bombedout town were moving stealthily through a bombedout town Almost everything the camera does is because one or both of the protagonists are doing the same thing further emphasising the correlation between form and contentrnrnThe opening scene serves as a superb introduction not just to the visual design but to the reasons for employing that visual design and the effectiveness of doing so The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break against a tree before being summoned to the meeting with Erinmore They rouse themselves and begin walking first past more resting soldiers then a camp where food and laundry are being prepared then down a ramp into the trenches the bucolic opening moments giving way to barbed wire and dirt Geographically its a short walk but thematically it covers considerable ground In a film thats all about scale and scope this sequence perfectly encapsulates one of the main thematic reasons behind the singleshot  to accurately convey the importance of geospatial relations We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because were moving in realtime through the _milieu_ with the characters we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary You shoot this opening sequence conventionally and you undercut this sense considerablyrnrnAlong slightly more conventional lines one also has to commend the work of production designer Dennis Gassner _Bugsy_ _Waterworld_ _Into the Woods_ Every location is visually unique  from a German bunker to an abandoned farmhouse to the bombedout remnants of ÉcoustSaintMein and every location feels authentic and lived in His design of No Mans Land is especially laudable not just in terms of the expected mess of barbed wire and debris but in the use and positioning of dead bodies dead animals and semidestroyed machinery with the whole thing having an almost postnuclear desolation feel Indeed the films No Mans Land is designed thematically Mendes has said _the first World War starts with literally horses and carriages and ends with tanks_ and this is mirrored in Gassners designs When the men first crawl into No Mans Land they immediately encounter a rotting flycovered horse carcass Gradually however the battlefield becomes more mechanised until they eventually pass through a German artillery positionrnrnAlso in a slightly more conventional sense one has to mention Deakins work during the nighttime scenes in ÉcoustSaintMein The entire village has been reduced to nothing but the shells of buildings and as we pass through the town the only source of light is from the flares arching through the sky which create very hard shadows in constant motion The whole thing is almost otherworldly and as the garish light traverses the sky its as if the ground itself is in motion almost liquidlike with the protagonists desperately trying to time their movements to ensure they stay hidden in the constantly shifting shadows It might be a little too aesthetically beautiful for a film aiming for such gritty realism but for aspiring cinematographers you wont find a better study in how to compose an image using light and shadowrnrnThematically by its very nature _1917_ is far more focused on the micro than the macro  you might learn something about life on the front but youll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict or even a sense of whos winning Partly because of this the film avoids for the most part the overwrought patriotism found in so many American World War II movies the kind of cartoonish jingoism that made Steven Spielbergs _Saving Private Ryan_ 1998 so obnoxious Indeed its relatively unimportant which side the protagonists are even on  their mission could have come from any of the combatants Their nationality is largely anonymous which is not something you can usually say of a war film but which does illustrate just how irrelevant lofty political issues were at ground level with everyone simply trying to survive as best they canrnrnOn the other hand however because the film is so tightly focused you shouldnt expect too much psychological insight If youre anticipating an existential treatise along the lines of Terrence Malicks _The Thin Red Line_ 1998 youll be severely disappointed Malicks masterpiece is for my money the greatest war picture ever made precisely because it subverts at every moment what a war picture is supposed to be Its about the war within rather than the war without about natures indifference to humanitys selfdestruction about the damage war does not to the mind or the body but the soul _1917_ is nowhere near this kind of thematic complexity its not even playing the same game but I would value its simple individualised insights above something like the empty temporal trickery of Christopher Nolans _Dunkirk_ 2017 which leans far too heavily into the keep a stiff upper lip chaps style of British filmmaking for my likingrnrnIn terms of problems Ive seen some critics argue that the oneshot structure is a gimmick which draws attention to itself and thus rather than being immersive actually has the opposite effect I admit that the film does take a little getting used to but you soon settle into its rhythms or lack thereof I would agree that the story is paperthin but thats pretty much by design One criticism I did have however is how wellgroomed Scholfield and Blake constantly are each with a perfect set of teeth One only need watch Peter Jacksons _They Shall Not Grow Old_ 2018 to see how unrealistic this is Indeed for most of the runtime the duo look like theyve just stepped out of the makeup trailer and its glaring enough on a couple of occasions to pull you out of thingsrnrnAll things considered though I thoroughly enjoyed _1917_ I thought the singleshot strategy worked exceptionally well and even if the film is weak from a characterstorylinetheme perspective it didnt really matter when the form and content are this well matched This could have become an empty technical exercise predicated on nothing but Mendes hasnt allowed that to happen and instead its a war film that does justice to its subject The more one knows about the Great War the more one realises that it was hell on Earth _1917_ doesnt make us feel what that hell was like Because no film no art form can do that But its a damn good approximation If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnhttpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnLet me just take a deep breath Wait one more Uff I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917 Usually I dont delve deep into technical stuff since most people dont know or dont care about these attributes but its impossible not to address Roger Deakins cinematography Its not the first time a film has been edited to appear as one shot a continuous take but it never fails to impress mernrnAlejandro G Iñárritus Birdman Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock all produce the same trick Even Mr Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal one shot episodes edited as well with the socalled stitches meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer hence giving that feeling that its all just one continuous take Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera when the latter pans movement similar to a headturn over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen or when the characters are simply going through a dark arearnrnSam Mendes Roger Deakins and Lee Smith editor all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie probably ever Yes it has a simple premise and the main narrative is basic but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much Even if you dont know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made its impossible to watch this film and not think something feels different about this one This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest best screen possible Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at allrnrnThroughout the whole runtime I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives I believe 1917 is the best one shot film to date Ive been using the quote signs for a reason dont mistake it for an actual one shot movie with Birdman as a close second If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting the former has dozens of nailbiting sequences featuring shootouts explosions and a lot of runningwalkingswimming through mud dead corpses blood and way too many nasty ratsrnrnI really have no words to describe Roger Deakins cinematography Its not merely a film its a whole experience Its not just another cool technical achievement Its the entire foundation of 1917 and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater However a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smiths work Dont forget this isnt an actual one shot movie If its been edited to look like one continuous take and if it actually does appear to be a single take then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else Yes he doesnt have to work with thousands of cuts I counted 14 but Im sure theres more but they still exist and he has to make sure no one feels them And he did so perfectlyrnrnMy last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman As the director Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film Skyfall but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of alltime As for Newman I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917s score is fantastic Hildur Guðnadóttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score but if Thomas Newman takes it Ill still be delightedrnrnA lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolans Dunkirk Theyre similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience Story and characterwise both movies dont really develop that much Nolans film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building I didnt mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations similar to 1917 However I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonistsrnrnGeorge MacKay and DeanCharles Chapmans characters have small arcs but they exist In the beginning Blake is the emotionaldriven character while Schofield seems to be the rational one We as the audience care about the mission first but as time goes by we learn about their personal traits and motivations By the end of the film I was crying Both play off of each other really well but its their dialogue that impresses me the most What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass it truly isnt If its not meaningful at the time its going to be The acting is more physical than anything and both deliver outstanding performancesrnrnI would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk I might be tempted to choose the former due to the recency effect but theres one small aspect that negatively affects both Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements dont work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home You will never feel or understand that immersive experience that everyone talks about You wont know what made people to be blown away You wont love it as much as everyone else So please do NOT miss 1917 in theatersrnrnSam Mendes Roger Deakins and Lee Smith Director director of photography editor Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of alltime Edited to look like one continuous shot 1917 is a mindblowing technical achievement elevated by Deakins always jawdropping cinematography Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score Mendes impeccable directing and Smiths seamless editing George MacKay and DeanCharles Chapman deliver outstanding physical performances but its the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight

get at home Its going straight into my Top10 Best Movies of 2019 and I hope youll love it as much as I dornrnRating A Director Sam Mendes employs distinctive but extraordinary shots in the first person during the twohour footage which makes the production work in many different ways Although it sometimes results too shaky it is thanks to George MacKay and DeanCharles Chapmans performances that 1917 preserves both sombre but optimistic tones throughout the montage In short this is an exceptional approach to memorialise the hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World WarrnrnWe are somewhere in France during the Trench Warfare 1915  1917 with a depleted British Army the atmosphere alongside with the dialogues can define by itself how was life at the front scarce water and food despair between soldiers to go home endless weapons and corpses scattered on the floor and so forth Corporals Blake and Schofield are told to attain a severeimpossible mission despite not having any reinforcements Before achieving this goal in sending General MacKenzie Bennedict Cumberbatch the infamous fallback letter both privates must penetrate the frightful No Mans Land and experience horrendous lifeanddeath encounters in many places rnrnRegardless of the silent second half the absence of preeminent performers and the woozy experience of watching the film in one sole perspective director Sam Mendes and executive producers deliver an eloquent portrayal about surprising facts of the fouryear global conflict For example both soldiers are bewildered by the superiority of the German trenches in proportions and in quality considering that historically they were far better equipped than the Allied ones which allow the audience the opportunity of a lifetime to analyse the condition millions of innocent citizens were facing The result improves with some accurate shots at landscapes underground warfare channels entire villages pulverised etcetera I must acknowledge the last fifteen minutes of the film it has been a long time since I spotted such an imposing ending Countless emotions appear regardless of having reached the climax What a masterpiece ladies and gentlemenrnrnWhat amazes me the most is that despite being a World War film 1917 does not give the impression in duplicating the ordinary details of previous samegenre releases such as Hacksaw Ridge 2017 Once Mr Gibson introduced a brief biography of Desmond Doss the main character he began recording some ultraviolent scenes as though you were spotting the most savage state of humankind As an alternative 1917 delivers some innovative procedures in creating a war film without increasing the brutal strength of instant classics as Saving Private Ryan rnrnCongratulationsrnrn80100 Very well made wardrama all in a oneshot like format Performance from George MacKay who I guess if nothing else could follow in the footsteps of Tom Cruise for his allout running ability Joking aside really enjoyed this film which manages to provide enough character development for me to care about his well being and task Probably my favorite of 2019 455 When it comes to impressive achievements in filmmaking 1917 deserves to be near the top of the conversation This war film which unfolds in two hours of real time is shot to appear as one continuous take Thankfully it is so much more than just a technical gimmick The showiness eases up as the emotional weight of the story unfolds but its still hard not to get stuck on the challenges and manner of the moviemaking rather than the characters that should be the focal point of the filmrnrnSet during the First World War the story follows Schofield George MacKay and Blake DeanCharles Chapman two young British soldiers who are given a seemingly impossible mission deliver a message across hostile territory to the front lines In a race against time these men must deliver the information within a couple of hours if they want to stop 1600 men and one of the soldiers brothers from walking straight into a deadly traprnrnThe plot is thin and the characters even more so Instead of learning more about Schofield and Blake the showy filmmaking technique commands the spotlight over learning more interesting aspects of these soldiers Its more of an experiment in look what I can do rather than compelling storytelling The camera becomes more of a character than the actual charactersrnrnDoes this matter Not really Roger Deakins is a master cinematographer and his technique here creates a fully immersive experience Paired with director Sam Mendes the two capture the trench warfare of WWI with clever camerawork that not only gives a real sense of the distance these men had to travel but makes you feel trapped alongside them as fellow soldiers sharing the same journey The intimate style of camerawork makes you feel as if you are right there in the trenches on the battlefield with these two young men Since the film is made to feel like it was shot in real time it becomes a psychological wartime thriller as time begins to run outrnrn1917 is a large scale spectacle that often overshadows its small scale story but theres no disputing that it is a grand achievement in filmmaking I see that a lot is made of the technique they use to film this movie in one continuous shot and it is very interesting but I must confess I am not a student of film merely a viewer So you will find no critiques of the director or editor or that sort of technical detail I like what I likernrnAnyway I enjoyed this movie more than I expected I would I am not big on war movies The scenery seemed great to me and though there were visually stunning scenes they didnt try to pile on explosion after explosion to cater to that crowd The two leads were at the same time heroes and regular guys I could almost picture myself in their position Moments of extreme courage and bravery under fire were balanced by totally justified panic and fear There were also quieter moments here and there breaks from the sometimes hard to bear tension Finally there was a plot twist that seems normal looking back at it but it shocked me at the time I will leave it at that and not risk giving anything awayrnrnSo while I probably wont watch it again anytime soon I do recommend it even to viewers like me who arent big on war movies As a side note one viewer warned others NOT to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan I guess he thought it doesnt compare with it Maybe I should give that movie a second look I think this film with very great shot also the actors was very goodrnBut the story didnt appeal to me haha Excellent original film It truly sucks you in straight from the very first scene until the last Theres nothing predictable in this well thought out and very tense soon to be classic An incredible journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat albeit without many surprises Beautifully shot Music was superb Premise interesting Acting was goodrnrnBut Ive never yelled at a characters complete incompetence as much as I did this one The Schofield dolt just stumbles around in a stupor the whole time doing just about everything he can wrong and its basically sheer luck more people didnt die because of this nitwit  Schofield is annoying at first and over time he grows to real irritationrnrnI cant express my true rage at this moron as the review would either be removed or filled with explicative deleted notations rnrnAs beautiful as the camera work and music is in this film its not nearly good enough to bump this rating any higher for the rage that it caused in me for this character Yet the cinematography and music were too good to let me give it the lowest ratingrnrnIts a well done movie about a complete explicative

combat experiences The film is known for the impressive effect of two continuous takes which was accomplished thru long takes and cinematic wizardryrnrnThe plot has similarities to Saving Private Ryan albeit taking place in a period 27 years earlier Of course with World War 1 you automatically think of films like Paths of Glory All Quiet on the Western Front 1979 and War Horse This is as good or better Its like a tour through the trenches and surrounding areas with all the shocking challenges thereof like rotting corpses rats booby traps aerial combat sudden death and crumbling villages mixed

hand the trailer looked ridiculous On the other I knew that Blumhouse and James Wan partnered for this After seeing the reviews I finally accepted that I had to see this movie and Im glad I did Was it ridiculous Absolutely M3GAN knew what it was It knew it was cheesy but had fun with it while also cranking up the tension and suspense So many cliche stop standing there and do something moments that surprisingly added to the stress and horror I wouldnt say the movie was ever scary but it was an excellent thriller Its a fun Blumhouse film that was selfaware and goofy while creepy and tense One of my favorite parts was the short scene with one of the worst detectives of all time that had me laughing out loud in the theater M3GAN is not a movie for everyone but people who like other Blumhouse films and dark comedies would find themselves at home with this movie Cady Violet McGraw finds herself living with her aunt Gemma Alison Williams after an altercation with a snow truck leaves her orphaned They dont exactly hit it off The older woman is a careerdriven lady who works at a toy manufacturer specialising in gadgets and gismos that use AI Thing is their market dominance is waning  much to the chagrin of boss David Ronny Chiang Competitors are catching up and the children are getting even more sophisticatedlazydependent She has a plan though  with her colleagues Cole Brian Jordan Alvarez and Tess Jen Van Epps she is working on the ultimate companion A doll that pairs with its owner and becomes almost siblinglike Snag with this film is that the plot is really all rather predictable the acting isnt up to much and I didnt find the eponymous  hideously overdressed  creation remotely menacing Indeed actually at times I found it particularly useful the neighbours wayward dog for example Its a competently strung together drama but its all just a little too sterile and bythenumbers for me It does fire a warning shot to parents who could become overreliant on their childrens own reliance on surrogate friendships and dependencies but once that point is made  and reiterated  the rest of this is frankly all rather unremarkable Its an enjoyable film it carries a pertinent antitech message but its not even close to being a horror filmrnrnFirst let me make one thing clear horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us Tension suspense fear and some scares are something that should not be missing Its the essence of horror cinema right So can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who arent old enough to ride a motorcycle Dont get me wrong the movie is good and I liked it but I cant consider it a horror movie It is not able to frighten anyone It has no scares we are able to predict them from a mile it has no tension or suspense As a horror movie forget it As the people say it rains but it doesnt get us wet do you understandrnrnThe script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys Things arent easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation It is in this context that we met M3GAN a prototype of a toy that is basically an android child that is capable of learning improving itself teaching and basically replacing parents in the tiring task of being parents The problem is that being a machine it has no notion of good or bad right or wrong and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming So its no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly cynical creature who kills without any remorsernrnThe film was directed by Gerard Johnstone an illustrious unknown Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan who we know from Saw and Conjuring 2 Wans brand is everywhere It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film a true horror piece Allison Williams does the main character well giving us yet another excellent job The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in Get Out and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities Amie Donald and Jenna Davis in turn give body and voice respectively to M3GAN complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purposernrnThe animatronic doll is nothing new Cinema has used this technology for decades and Spielbergs shark  one of the first and most infamous examples  is proof of that However the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio The sound particularly the sound effects related to the doll also deserves praise and the cinematography even though it doesnt bring new or innovative features makes the best use of it all The film has good costumes and convincing sets as well as a very good modern and fun soundtrack Its on the editing table that things go wrong either because of the excessive length or because it wants to target young age groups the film was badly edited and the cuts are rough There are even scenes from the trailer that because they are not in the final cut make it difficult to understand the story for example the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young ownerrnrnThe only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that in the medium term there will be some toy similar to M3GAN Advances in AI computing robot creation and design or other technologies make it plausible Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that due to their characteristics will be considered alive and as such immortal and therefore superior to the humans who created them I dont think anyone wants to see that Therefore the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology visible not only in M3GAN but also in Cadys technological dependence I can do nothing but applaud the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones iPads or computers to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together normal and healthy with other children Im not making it up this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world I think there is a time for everything in life and childhood shouldnt be spent looking at screens and LCDs', NOW());

itrnrnRating B Click here for a video version of this review httpsyoutube5VSDwYyxjsArnrn_Extraction_ has just been released on Netflix and stars Chris Hemsworth as Tyler Rake a former Special Forces soldier who now works as a mercenary He takes on a high risk job rescuing the kidnapped child of a drug lord Sounds pretty much like every other action movie doesnt it Well it kinda is and it kinda isntrnrnIt is a fairly standard action movie from the point of view of having a simple story a clichéd hero with a tragic past lots of fights car chases and explosions But what steps this up somewhat is the quality of the action This movie was put together by Sam Hargrave and the Russo brothers who of course all made huge contributions to the Marvel cinematic universe and are therefore people who understand how to string action sequences togetherxa0rnrnThis experience shows in brilliantly choreographed fight scenes that echo John Wick but which have a more real world feel like Jason Bourne Theres fights that take place in a single room others across multiple floors in an apartment block and others out in the open street Wherever the action needs to be the filmmakers take you there and make you feel like youre part of the actionxa0rnrnThis is most evident in a car chase sequence that we paused and rewatched because it was so well put together Shot to look like one like 15ish minute take the camera goes from outside the car to insidexa0the car then out again and around the car and then back in and out the back window it was excellent Ive seen some footage of how they filmed the externals and Hargrave literally strapped himself to the hood of a car to get the shots  a benefit of having a Stunt Coordinator as a Director I guess The end result was that it justxa0added another level of intensity to an already ballsout sequencexa0rnrnSo yeah this movie is one heck of a ride from start to finish and while it might be light on story the real reason to watch it is for its incredible actionxa0 The Dhaka in the film is surely from another multiverse This may in future be tied up with Doctor Strange Multiverse Of Madness or something And btw if Russo Bros call it cinema again Mustafa Scorsese swears by Allah that he will shoot himself Really good watch probably wont watch again but can recommendrnrnChris Hemsworth gives a stellar carry of this movie  Not for lack of trying on the writers part the bulk of quality in this is movie is Hemsworth shooting his way through India  The reasoning of which really isnt all that important in fact it is a designed adversity that he is trying to save a kids life  Without even watching the movie I could have told you it wasnt worth killing so many people to rescue one kidrnrnThe action is excellent and worth watching the rest of the movie hell you could even fast forward through the parts where theyre not fighting  It reminded me a lot of Daredevil series but focused on gunsrnrnIf you want to see some good action give this a go but I cant guarantee the actual story is anything youll really get into Although the action is probably too abundant and the plot leaves much to be desired one cannot help but admire the 11 minute pursuit scene that looks as if its been shot in a single takernrn710 Theres no two ways about it Extraction is too long On the plus side its violent yet painless It gives us a flyonthewall view of the action at the same time the overtheshoulder thirdperson perspective assures us that what we have here is little more than videogame violence except on two occasions and even then we might give the film the benefit of the doubt if were feeling generousrnrnExtraction has a sound premise and lots of action pieces to go with it highlights include an ingeniously shot high speed chase that keeps us on the edge of the backseat and a brutal close quarters handtohand combat between Chris Hemsworth and Randeep HoodarnrnThere is another much less impressive fight however The villain employs children and teenagers as street soldiers and there is a scene where they corner Hemsworth in an alley and our hero in a very unheroic moment proceeds to beat the crap out of themrnrnTechnically this sequence is not gratuitous its actually there for a reason The problem is that the ending somehow seems to simultaneously justify and negate that reason The other time Extraction goes too far is when the Child in the Badass and Child Duo is forced to shoot David Harbours character deadrnrnThe rationale is that he does it to save Hemsworths life but this doesnt stand up under scrutiny At a certain point Hemsworth and the kid are picked up by Harbour an old friend and former comradeinarms of the former who hides them in his housernrnFrom the moment this character is introduced we know because weve seen it in countless other action movies that sooner rather than later hes going to betray the hero so were just waiting for the other shoe to drop Its bad enough to have a teenager pull the trigger but doing it in the name of such a tired cliché is inexcusablernrnMoreover Harbors character and everything that has to do him should have been dropped altogether because his introduction at the halfway point results in a slump from which Extraction only recovers half an hour later when a rocket sends a helicopter into a tailspin at least it got my attention backrnrnThis film is the directorial debut for Sam Hargrave who would do well to study David Mamets Spartan or Steven Soderberghs Haywire for two textbook examples of economical action moviesrnrnWe dont really care much about the heros past what we want is to see him rescue the boy and get him to safety in the most entertaining and expeditious way possible  straight to the point without beating around the bushrnrnNow if the filmmakers feel it necessary for him to bond emotionally with the boy then let him do it on the go over the course of their adventure There is within Extraction a serviceable action movie that its creators have almost ruined by trying to stretch it beyond the limitations of its genre I only watched this for David Harbour and he was great Is it the best action movie made by Netflix Could it be true rnExtraction movie is an action movie based on a comic called Ciudad which is a Spanish word means cityrnrnThe story of the movie is about a mercenary who is recruited to rescue a boy who was kidnapped by a very dangerous gang I saw the advertisement for this movie and said it might be vulgar You have seen many great action scenes with many explosions guns and pursuits Yes it is a strong movie in terms of performancernrnThe world surrounding the movie is a poor cruel and frightening world that was shown You see most of the scenes of the film were filmed in the slums of Bangladesh and some in certain areas in India It was depicted as a gloomy world with a lot of crime and corruption The director manages to bring out this world shockinglyrnrnDirector Sam Hargrave has a background in action and law and I have seen similar films directed in this way The director understands action scenes and knows how to build a powerful moment and hold the viewers breath in itrnrnThere are some scenes that contributed to the decrease in the evaluation of people I wanted to explain or explain more about some situations so that the peoples actions would be more logical to the viewer There were many scenes that were not deep and some scenes that contained poor and superficial effects and devoid of depth of meanings such as the movement of smokernrnrnChris Hemsworth is an action star an actual action hero a powerful action hero and he carried the film on his shoulders but he did as the director told him The director didnt want to expand the deep action scenes I do not deny that if the shots or the frame were wider and deeper than this if the cameras used in filming the scenes were farther away or their movement or vibration while filming the scenes were less than this these scenes would have become clearer and more impressive', NOW());

articlernhttpswwwmaketheswitchcomauarticlereviewknivesoutawhodunnitworthyofagathachristiesherculepoirot If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree reviews please follow my blog rnhttpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnKnives Out has been shown in numerous festivals and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them Therefore its hype grew more and more until its wide release date Before the film I cant deny that I was indeed affected by the whole a whodunnit like you havent seen in years I went into the theater with high expectations not only due to the festival praise but due to its jawdropping cast Its uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a bad movie especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it yes I like The Last Jedi and even if I didnt he did other stuff you know Its one of those films everyone knows its going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the worldrnrnEven the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public So does it live up to its hype or it fails to reach such high expectations Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best mysterysuspense stories of the millennium everyone is doing the whole best X of the decade Im going one step beyond This is a film I know Im going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years Usually when it comes to whodunnits people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who did it the movie loses its interest This is rarely true and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesnt need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great storyrnrnThis screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season Every little line of dialogue means something Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative except for Jaeden Martells Its been halfaday since Ive seen it and for every question that my brain comes up with theres an answer lying on someones words or actions Its such an intricate complex extremely subtle script One with so many tiny little details that its impossible to catch them all on a first viewingrnrnI genuinely love the first act even if its the one where I have a minor issue Rian Johnson doesnt waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene interviewing each and every member of the family Its through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue and outstanding performances For example with a single sentence and a particular bodyface expression Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni her character Rian plays with charactertypes and cliches in such an intelligent manner He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche then it doesnt then it does againrnrnThats one of the reasons I couldnt figure out the mystery until the last act reveal Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path new developments arise meant to mislead confuse and create doubts Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film They feel intellectually superior just because they found out before everyone else First of all I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before times up and end up disappointed and bored Then honestly anyone who says I guessed it theres a 99 chance that theyre either lying or not answering correctly to the question who killed Harlan If youve seen the movie youll understand what Im trying to expressrnrnI dont want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical Im not trying to say I couldnt figure it out so no one can Please if you havent seen the film judge the previous paragraph after your viewingrnrnThroughout the second and third acts loose ends start to tie up ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal From the marvelous cinematography with those classic closeups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory to the remarkable editing the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job The suspense is held at high levels and it reaches limitbreaking points with Marta Cabreras Ana de Armas narrative Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances with Chris Evans Ransom following right behind Literally everyone else offers excellent displays and help carry a story filled with mystery but also with a lot of humorrnrnHowever I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are Ana might be a bit unknown to most people Ive been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049 so Im ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers Craig who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character hes been playing for years instead offers a unique take on the Detective role Just like Evans both have been playing iconic characters for years so its sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or sornrnMy only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film Honestly I love that aspect of it Its like Rian knew some people would complain about it so he made sure to have a couple of characters Jaeden Martells Jacob and Katherine Langfords Meg somewhat resembling the socalled snowflakes and all that No my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first acts interrogatories Its great that every character gets their own motivations but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable moviernrnIn the end Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits Ive ever seen Knives Out Rian proves that not only hes a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances Chris Evans being right behind With one of the best screenplays of the year the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end even if you guess who did it beforehand Masterfully written dialogue remarkable editing and great use of classic cinematography techniques Its an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant politicalsocial layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative Dont miss itrnrnRating A I did not think that _Last Jedi_ was a very good movie but I have always been a fan of Rian Johnson And honestly _Knives Out_ is a strong contender for his best work yet I have never seen a whodunnit like this before Seeing this in a theatre was the poppypoppypaper of moviegoing experiences because I so enjoyed that rnrn_Final rating  Very strong appeal A personal favourite_ This case is like a donutrnwith a holernin the middle of a donut holernActuallyrnits a donut within a donuts holernrnKnives Out subverted my expectationsin a good way A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences Perfectly balance as all things should be It basically pulls a Hitchcock on usrnrnRian Johnson is a great director but at times has silly ideas On the other hand when given the right material I think hes a great director and writer Hes also a clever man but never came off as annoying The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall settingrnrnOne of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mysterycomedyrnrnThe cast is stellar but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig Ana de Armas and Chris Evans I loved Daniel Craigs Southern drawl which I didnt expect at first but I was amazed of how far he went for it Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from House of Cards He plays detective Benoit Blanc AKA CSI KFC At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie which was brilliantly delivered by Craig He should seriously try out more comedy rolesrnrnDose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roths Knock Knock Well look at her now She was absolutely excellent in this movie The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character cant lie and whenever she dose she vomits on the spot How ironic yet I love the comedic irony behind itrnrnChris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations The over privilege black sheep of the family This is very against type for Evans especially when his character hates dogs which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since hes a dog lover in real life Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccablernrnThe rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others However that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offerrnrnToni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crimewriter Harlan Thrombey Christopher Plummer Despite the small screen time Plummer is still charming as always While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play Shes uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation as early on she reminds everyone that her father just diedrnrnJudging it as a whodunit mystery the pay off itself is slick The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience Theres an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout Nothing deep or new but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thingrnrnOverall rating My House My Rules My Coffee That certainly not what I was expectingrnrn Whodunitrn Rian Johnsonrn Whyrn To subvert the tropes of yet another subgenre properlyrnrnAs divisive as it was I neither loved nor hated the loveitorhateit The Last Jedi Maybe because Im not a huge fan of the muchbeloved saga But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway The first half almost turned me off completely tons of lame jokes and outofcharacter moments that indicate that Johnsons biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but The second half of the film was way better It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first halfrnrnIn Knives Out Johnson didnt add a new spin on the whodunit subgenre of detective fiction he took it and turned it on its head He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this subgenre and boy he did that so exquisitely and gracefully but he also by using a new and very effective building block Drama It doesnt sound new isnt it But actually relying on it here in this kind of a story is nothing short of revolutionary and thats simply lies in the fact its unprecedented to build upon it here The result is nothing but marvellous And although that at some point the main concern of the plot wasnt the murder mystery per se the mystery didnt lose its sharpness even a tiny bit And thats a strong proof that everything worked and integrated seamlessly I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime which flies by and to be honest I think every single joke landed perfectly The film also suggest a political agenda thats exquisitely woven into the plot and provides a sharp social commentary thats impressively subtlernrnNot only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful subgenre but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the starstudded cast I didnt know that Chris Evans Captain America himself would be better as well an AntiCaptain America  Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal with his southern accent and caricature detective character and Jaeden Martell IT is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey As for Curtis Langford Plummer Collette and Shannon Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities and of their facial expressions and features especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance The real standout though is Ana de Armas I mean she was good in Blade Runner 2049 but here as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio she proves shes an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions and changing them readily only with her eyes Honestly I think she should have been nominated for an OscarrnrnOverall Im really surprised how much I loved this film With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulouslynuanced and witty albeit slightly toostructured screenplay I think this is my favourite  even if its not my highestrated  film of 2019 You know what this film is actually terrible its very pretentious its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good it has an overabundance of plot twists it underutilized its stellar ensemble and it has a lot of plot holes or in this case donut holes Excuse me I gotta leave right nowrnrn9510 Fun little murdermystery starts off great kind of loses a little steam in the middle before rebounding nicely at the end Fine performances all around though especially Daniel Craig reminded me why he was also great in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo even with a starkly different tone Also makes me remember Rian Johnson is a fine filmmaker loved Brick 405 This film had quite the rewatch value keeping a consistent yet entertaining thrill ride Rian Johnsons original tale is strikingly filled with a talented ensemble oldschoolmysterythrills and a sharp envisioning Knives Out keeps the audience on their toes and brings a surprising delight towards its conclusion Best way to watch is on big screen Caving to popular opinion and seeing this was a bad decision Daniel Craigs accent is the only interesting aspect and you can get that from the trailer 80s actors meet the younger generation of Marvel and series for a huge camp it up under the patronage of Bond himself A great movie entertaining and it has you playing detective right away Great for all the Columbo wannabees Incredible Loved itrnrnEven on just one watch its one of my favourites already  I have a feeling Ill be revisiting this a lot I had heard amazing things about this since its release and man is the hype befitting Its a brilliant 131 minutes even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it isrnrnThe casting is impeccable Daniel Craig is superb in the role of Blanc Ive actually found Craig a tad hitandmiss  even with emJames Bondem  but he is utterly superb here even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accentrnrnIts by no means The Craig Show though Ana de Armas is excellent as Marta she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her characters situation fully believable Shes great from starttofinishrnrnMichael Shannon is top notch too I literally always find him fun to watch  from emBoardwalk Empireem to even emKangaroo Jackem Jamie Lee Curtis Chris Evans Don Johnson Toni Collette Lakeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer are all fantastic toornrnThe plot is enthralling its crafted together expertly It reveals bits way earlier than I was predicting which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story The comedy is also very funny I laughed a fair amountrnrnA joy to watch I havent got a bad word to say about emKnives Outem An incredibly wellcrafted and beautifully shot whodunit with an impressive cast Knives Out keeps the viewer on the wrong track thanks to the ingenious script bringing a surprising delight towards its conclusion but without losing rewatch valuernrn1010 So this is a bad remake of Clue butrnrnThe bad scores are because of Star Wars fans And honestly I am sure that some of them are but once more we see people attacking anyone that doesnt give a Rain Johnson 10 out of 10rnrnThe bad scores are conservative trolls And once again we see people and Johnson attacking anyone that doesnt like this filmrnrnOnce again people are throwing a fit because other people dont like the exact same thing they dornrnBut to be honest again I can see that This is overtly political and by overtly I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone at just about every opportunity to inject their politics into itrnrnOther than that it is kind of like Clue if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so selfaware they cant help but failrnrnSo basically that is what you are getting Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics And that is all you are gettingrnrnBut hey if you havent seen Clue you might like it And if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything you will totally like itrnrnThe rest of us are just going to watch Clue A novel written specifically for a dramatic workrnrnThe story of the movie is simply that we have a person murdered and a group of people suspected of being involved in killing this person because they all have an interest or benefit that this person should die The movie is simply ask who killing old Harlan ThrombeyrnrnOften these types of films and these types of stories that contain puzzles and crimes are based on old books such as Agatha Christie Sherlock Holmes or any other novel but this story from the movie was written specifically in order to be made in a dramatic form because the story was written for the cinema and the way the story was implemented was farfetched Completely different from traditional methods This is the strong aspect of the film due to its reliance on the theatrical system It makes you contemplate the music the method of filming and the placement of the characters one after the other as if you are watching a theatrical performancernrnThe most beautiful thing about this theatrical show is the way the characters are presented Each character sees it for the first time when they are called for investigation by the police and who they are and what is their relationship to the victim But what is beautiful is when the next character is identified and we know who shehe is and what herhis relationship is to the victim them We start to doubt the stories and information given by the previous character to the investigatorsrnrnWith more than one character and with more than one investigation the contradictions will become clear This will bring us to the question that comes to our minds

review httpsboundingintocomicscom20221212guillermodeltorospinocchioreviewfamiliarfantasybranchesintowondrousstopmotionandthehorrorsofwar I didnt even know that Guillermo del Toro had made an adaptation of Pinocchio until my daughter and oldest son told me they wanted to watch it during our traditional movie evening yesterday Wow that was a different take on Pinocchio indeedrnrnPinocchio the original is not surprisingly one of the movies I watched as a kid and which is quite dear to me A movie from the time when the name Disney actually meant something and when they made actual family movies instead of woke crud for the small but loudmouthed and fanatical minority Needless to say I have not even contemplated to watch Disneys latest remake of the originalrnrnBut then Guillermo del Toro movies I often like and well the kids who are also very antiwoke wanted to watch it so I did not have much choice but to watch itrnrnI do indeed have some reservations about the theme used in the movie but overall it was a good moviernrnThe movie is more geared towards adults or at least young adults than Disneys original It is much more dark and less humorous But then with Guillermo del Toro at the helm that is not really a surprise is itrnrnSince I did not know anything about this movie until I started to watch it I sat through the entire movie wondering if it was done with stopmotion figures or CGI made to look like stopmotion It turnes out that it is indeed stopmotion and damned impressive stopmotion at that Really well donernrnThe story which has little to do with the original Disney one to be honest is not bad but here we come to my main gripe with the movie I did not really like the setting in fascist Italy with a lot of the movie preaching about fascism It is really beating a dead horse and it made the movie darker than it had to be I know Pinocchio is an Italian story so they could not really have set it in communist Russia even though that would have been much more relevant if they really wanted to have some background bad guys Still I just wished they would have found some other themernrnThe ending is also nothing like the original Disney movie It is not entirely a tragic ending but it is certainly not an overly happy one either It is a good ending but again more an adult ending than a childrens story endingrnrnOverall though I liked the movie It was a good movie and an intelligent and technically very well done adaptation of the Pinocchio story Its good even if I wouldnt say its anything better or worse than its Disney animated counterpart  at least it is a marked improvement on that aforementioned companys remake mindrnrnThe big win of emGuillermo del Toros Pinocchioem is the stopmotion animation which is extremely nice indeed As for everything else Nothing leaps out of my mind if Im honest even within 30mins of watching it I personally found the design of the titular character to be just OK same goes for Sebastian J Cricket  CornrnI did like the casting of Ewan McGregor and David Bradley particularly the latter Christoph Waltz meanwhile is alright in his role The more serious vibe of the film is a positive though I dont think it comes across as deep as it intended eg that last line from Cricket isnt in my opinion as effective as the film seems to think it is As for the music fine but forgettable for mernrnAgain its passable I just unfortunately didnt overly care as much as I wanted to for this story and its characters The 1940 film did it slightly better fwiw Im not sure why everyone compares this to Disneys version They both stole the main characters from Carlo Collodis 19th century book My father used to read it to me Sure Guillermo took a much bigger artistic license than Disney So what What modern director even attempted to be completely faithful to a book except Peter JacksonrnrnThat said there quite a few logic holes in Guillermo del Toros version that took me right out of suspended disbelief Takes it out of Oscar territory for me but I dont vote LOL Aside from that the artistic effort was superb More true to the original vibe of the story than the Disney version but the parallels of the Italian fascists could have had more of an impact The family tragedy did have an impact though which was very moving The idea of Love will give you life is great but as we all know isnt true which hindered any inspiration It would be great if there were good and fairly evil spirits and if there were Id like mine played by Tilda Swinton please but there arent  that shouldnt take away from the story but it doesnt work as a life lesson The darkness was great but needed more fascism not a phrase I use that often rnrnI liked the film but it seemed to evade all age groups too scary for under 12s too slow for 12  15 not gripping enough for 1518 and not enough parallelling with the rise of fascism or Tilda Swinton for over 40s Lovely score lovely stop motion which we dont see enough of nowadays Lots of potential not quite reached in terms of Ewan McGregor and plotrnCutting room floor inside the whale and unless youre going to do it as a main theme the fascist elementrnrnLovely score

and forgettable martialarts thriller that delves deeper into the character but outside of Henry Goulding who was good in the role theres not much else to the film The rest of the cast wasnt terribly charismatic and Samara Weaving talents is completely wasted in a small supporting role shows up basically for the third act I dont know while the first two GI Joe films werent very good there were a few entertaining moments this one I found pretty boring for the most part worse yet the fight scenes suffered from bad editing and poor lighting 255 I actually liked the two first GI Joe movies GI Joe The Rise of Cobra and GI Joe Retaliation This one not so muchrnrnIt could have been a really good movie but it ended up as a huge disappointment The story should have been a cool revenge story but it ended up being a convoluted mess making Snake Eyes one of the bad guys for most of the movie It is also hugely predictable after the first 20 minutes of the movie Did the writers really think that the twists would come as a surprise for anyone They probably did since Hollywod writers usually reside on the low end of the intelligence scale nowadays Putting three of those hacks together to write a movie doesnt help of coursernrnI could have accepted all of that if the rest would have been cool with lots of fights and special effects Sadly the movie is mediocre at best in these areas as wellrnrnSnake Eyes is not only a bad guy but he is rather stupid as well as devoid of any charisma His acting is quite poor which can be said for most of the actors actually Apart from the mediocre acting theres really no one in the movie that you feel like rooting for No one stands out everyone just excels in mediocrity The only person in the entire movie that has any coolness factor worth talking about is Scarlett but she is not in the movie for more than a few scenesrnrnThere are a few scenes with some special effects cars flipping over huge snakes etc but not really that much for this kind of movie That could have been fine since this movie should be a lot about martial arts Amazingly enough not even here does it deliver Most of the martial arts scenes involve a lot of flipping around with arms and swords but they mostly look like they have been written for a PG rated TV show for teens and preteens They are simply poor Tommy looks like he needs to take a dump before every fight with that ridiculous pose of hisrnrnThis is not a 1star movie as some rate it Thats just ridiculous It has some entertainment value However it could have been so much better Unfortunately I suspect this movie has done the GI Joe franchise a disservice for some time to come Its one thing offering us Henry Golding as a pretty chap youd want to take home to meet your mother its quite another telling him to abstain from shaving for a few days and hope that turns him into a convincing highly trained ninja Thats what is in store for us here as this latest GI Joe spin off presents our hero as the rescuer of the heir of an ancient Japanese clan  Tommy Andrew Koji Once he is thoroughly ingratiated with this noble family it transpires that old Snake Eyes has an agenda all of his own  and its not exactly honourable The rest of the film follows a well trodden path of suspicion betrayal reconciliation and  of course  loads of epic looking sword fighting and gravitydefying action scenes As with so many films in this genre way too much emphasis has been placed on the look of the thing  the characters are instantly forgettable the plot thinner than any rice paper could ever hope to be and the ending dragged this quite unnecessarily over the two hour mark It needs a big screen to do the photography and visuals justice but maybe just pay daytime rates', NOW());

conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion  as youd expect The story is all over the pace though and the proliferation of Spideys seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive and bankable rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited andor confused familial love or teenage angst more suitable in a soap The dialogue has its moments  assuming you can catch it  and theres a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched and remembering the first  in my view far better

httpsboundingintocomicscom20230607spidermanacrossthespiderversereviewastunninglabyrinthinebenchmarkforanimation I dont know but in my humble opinion the punk SpiderMan really needed to look like

a great pop culture reference but at least an injoke for the punk community  I mean throw us a bone here  He spent half his time mocking us anyway in a pretty hysterical way at least give us the laugh when they do the face revealrnrnAnyway its not bad  Miles is less boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where hes developed the moniker Mild Morales  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points Hey Marvel you could learn a lesson here  rnrnBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey who seemed to be the star of the show

though its not bad  Its better than just about all of the current SuperHero movies and honestly its probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in because it isnt totally political BS Rating 95rnrnOverall another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a wellrounded story about a SpiderMan who is trying to find his place in the world with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts I dont have that much to say about SpiderMan Across the SpiderVerse the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse except that its easily one of the best films of the year Its the type of achievement in animation thats not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better its aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids teens and adultsrnrnMiles Morales voice of Shameik Moore is back for part two and hes happily fulfilling his

Johnson Karan Soni Issa Rae and others from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villainrnrnThe plot is complex but the story is terrific The parallel universes at play dont feel like a gimmick and there are real stakes for every character There are strong messages about teamwork friendship power and responsibility and its nice to see more female representation in a

curious about Indian movies give this one a try Yes its three hours long but trust me the time goes flying by This is truly an action movie a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end My first exposure to Telugu Cinema is when I saw my wife watching a near naked guy running in the forest chased by a Tiger looking so shredded that I thought my wife was appreciating the sweaty bulbous body of a forest guy I dismissed it immediately as another macho movie afterall which is not my wifes favorite its Korean movies Until I saw a raving review of the Netflix viewer in Youtube who arent Indians but Americans and Europeans Now that caused me curiosity So I decided to watch it and then watched it again First I cant believe the quality of CGI in most cases and the great acting of the very charismatic actors NTR and Ram Charan With Ajay Degn and Alia Bhatt making the movie an experience of a lifetime The movie is brimming with action drama and great fun that I wished I watched it in bigscreen I even eatched its Telugu version Although the Britactors arent too convincing the entire movie is bursting with energy and drama and with it a series of suspending your belief that a movie this good can feel so short even if its 3 hours The movie led me on a journey of watching old Rajamouli NTR and Ram Charan movies I have been familiar with Devgns Drishyam also good I just had ti watch this several times due to so many things one can find and the beauty of friendship and relationships in the world of freedom fighters This is 11 but I can only give it 1010 for sanity reason By Louisa Moore  wwwScreenZealotscomrnrnRRR is one of those movies where just about everyone who watches it loves it Its an overthetop historical spectacle about a violent uprising in 1920s India offering a fictitious retelling of real events This international blockbuster has everything thrilling action sequences adrenalinecharged stunts a rousing story and euphoric Bollywood dance scenes that are nothing short of showstoppingrnrnThe plot centers around two reallife India revolutionaries Alluri Sitarama Raju Ram Charan Teja and Komaram Bheem NT Rama Rao Jr and imagines what would have happened had the two met and become friends In RRR the men join together to fight against the British Raj and brutal colonialism in order to save the people The trail of vengeance begins after a young girl is abducted and Bheem takes action to free her from the tyrannical regime Raju is working for the enemy and becomes a strong adversary to Bheems rescue mission Clashes and chaos ensue when the two start working togetherrnrnThis movie is crazy ridiculous silly excessive and absolutely amazing Director SS Rajamouli has an enviable skill and master of the craft as he puts together some truly inventive and unforgettable sequences Everything is executed with precision and it all works no matter how outrageous the ideas sound like unleashing an army of CGI animals into an unsuspecting crowd This is a strong achievement in directing and its one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seenrnrnPart of the reason the film works so well is due to the two charismatic leads who can act dance sing and do their own stunts Theyre bonafide action stars with old Hollywood charisma and charm and their screen presence is unmatched I could happily watch these two in anything Theyre so good together that audiences should be begging for a sequelrnrnIts not all lighthearted fun and Rajamouli takes his historical setting seriously The film doesnt gloss over brutality and violence and there are upsetting scenes of abuse and death Men women and children are put in great peril The heroes in the movie are mostly men and women are the ones who need to be rescued This is a macho story and not a feminist one but that doesnt make much of a difference to the classic action movie vibernrnEverything is dialed up to the maximum level and every second of the movies 3hourplus run time is packed RRR is a crowdpleasing cinematic experience thats intoxicating exhilarating and delivers a ton of fun It may also inspire viewers to research Indias history and learn more about the countrys revolutionaries which is an interesting undertaking in its own right This movie is one really fun actionpacked superhero watch The CGI of course is fantastic What I love about this movie though is that its not just an empty trivial story as an excuse for CGI Quite the contrary The story itself is a fictionalized version of a very real revolutionary period just before Gandhis nonviolence movement took the leadrnrnIf anyone could make any complaint at all it would be that the British roles are caricatures Honestly though what do we white Americans know of how Imperial Britain treated its nonwhite subjects We DO know that in 1919 British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters killing hundreds of men women and children So the film is steeped in real history Perhaps the caricatures were Rajamoulis way of sidestepping the issue by allowing the viewer to accept them at the same level of unreality as the two super heroes of the filmrnrnThe film itself is over the top fun and actionpacked It even has the requisite Bollywood dance scenes I loved the way Ram became Rama the mythological Hindu archer an avatar of Vishnu I probably missed other cultural references but I suspect that when the two superheroes cooperate they have 4 arms  that is Shiva the destroyer with a bow and arrow in two of the arms The story and production design are gripping SS Rajamouli does such an amazing job with the pacing that three hours seems to fly by before you can even say popcorn', NOW());

with the admittedly annoying and cliche I enjoy every type of film While this is ultimately true I do tend to love scifi and a couple of other genres more than the rest I find scifi to be one of the most creative filmmaking sources partially due to the infinite potential of its storytelling From extraterrestrial life to an exploration of deep space our world knows so little of whats beyond our planet which makes the respective genre a perfect framework for imaginative unique fiction Voyagers features an interesting cast but Neil Burger was behind the disappointingly hollow Divergent saga so I couldnt help but go in with very low expectationsrnrnEven anticipating a tough watch I never thought Voyagers would be a contender for one of the worst flicks of the year The general premise is far from being groundbreaking even with the notthatoriginal spin that it puts on the colonization of another planet concept Still its considered a formula because it worked on several other occasions It just doesnt in this movie The group of young people bred separately from the outer world could have received an innovative inventive arc but instead follows an incredibly generic dull lazy character development path The chaos and mayhem triggered by a single person  who just so happens to embody literally everything thats wrong with our society  is as extremely forced as it is utterly ridiculousrnrnIn fact it even raises logical questions regarding the premise of the film Obviously people can be born into the same place with the same education morals and everything that comes with growing up and still develop a distinct personality However Burger doesnt demonstrate why some characters end up challenging the authority and questioning their purpose Everything happens because it needs to happen A character performs an irrational action because the plot demands it Most of the story development is given through absurdly childish dialogues where a character repeatedly asks why to someone with some sort of an answerrnrnBurgers screenplay barely survives due to the lack of any exciting characteristic From an obviously misleading subplot to the frustratingly predictable main narrative this movie carries zero surprises The horrendously choppy abrupt editing work Naomi Geraghty turns an already complicated watch into something borderline irritating Add weirdly creepy nonsensical imagery of random life events on completely arbitrary points of the runtime and Voyagers becomes a really hard film to genuinely enjoy With no flow between scenes the primary mission is lost in the first minutes and the characters fail to complete any resemblance of an arcrnrnActually its ironically funny how Isaac Hempstead Wright Bran Stark in Game of Thrones continues the trend of not doing anything relevant in a movie or TV series Unfortunately not even the cast saves this disaster Tye Sheridan Dark Phoenix LilyRose Depp Crisis and Fionn Whitehead Dunkirk try their hardest with the poor scripts but some line deliveries are truly cringeworthy Colin Farrells The Gentlemen character suffers from one of Burgers numerous bad decisions ending up as yet another forgettable component of the film The ending arrives way too fast something that attests to the way too fast pacingrnrnIn these cases where I struggle to find positives in the two pillars of any movie  story and characters  I turn to the technical elements to help me out Sadly Voyagers is one of the rare onelocation films that doesnt feel suspenseful or claustrophobic despite many efforts From the surprisingly ordinary score Trevor Gureckis to the bythenumbers camera work Enrique Chediak theres not a single aspect I can take with me as an at least that was great thought I guess the set design looks futuristic enough for a spaceship but once again its nothing viewers havent seen beforernrnVoyagers holds a wellknown successful scifi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting unsurprising frustratingly generic development path Neil Burgers screenplay fails to deliver a creative captivating story with compelling characters offering the complete opposite From the terrible editing work to the extremely lazy plot development passing through cringeworthy dialogues and randomly weird irrelevant imagery its tough to find a positive aspect in such a hollow movie Even though most of the runtime is spent in a single location the suspense levels are close to zero The themes of the story are clear from the getgo but the execution of almost every plot point or character action feels incredibly forced The set design is the only technical component worthy of some appreciation Not even a talented cast can overcome the awful scripts A contender for one of the worst films

each entry in this trilogy the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is With Ends there is no tension and no horror there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced Corey Cunningham Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey it had no place being centerstage in the final installment Overall this movie was slightly better

Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying although the story didnt build to the climax well Sadly that is where the pros stop The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the buildup of the first two films and focused on a new character that didnt matter to the overall story and didnt have much impact on the film As a result Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed An unfortunate end to a horror franchise that started way back in 1978 rnrnHalloween Ends is an inarticulate mess that fails to build on past films Instead it delivers an incomprehensible story that makes little to no sense save that it brings the overriding story to a somewhat confused conclusion rnrnOn the upside solid acting and some tense jump scare moments but really its not enoughrnrnIn summary a reasonable cast in a poorly scripted film that adds little to nothing that is meaningful to the tale of serial killer Michael Myers Its a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS 2022 is being classed as a bad terrible or disgraceful motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookiecutterrnrnThis film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a

into the film and thats it maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his woundsrnrnThe evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey played by Rohan Campbell was the standout characterrnrnIssues Yes there are some  the narration and memoir aspect werent needed and Coreys mum erm Ill leave it therernBut I admire this film oh boy do I Id rather the risk be taken than them fall back into the same old routinernrnNow before I start the Corey Appreciation Society all I have left to say is give a new biscuit a try _Halloween Ends_ does provide what it promises and thats a proper end to the Laurie Strode saga However the birth of a new rushed hotheaded and sloppier version of The Shape seems to take precedence only to be squashed before Laurie and Michael meet one last time Entertaining

its only scream yells put me out of my misery pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise Rohan Campbell Corey is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed He has also attached himself to Allyson Andi Matichak who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering Laurie Jamie Lee Curtis and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama all of her demons are fleeflowing and we are heading slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers This is far too long virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then there isnt even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy The production is adequate but JLC doesnt really feature often enough  as in Halloween Kills 2021 to make much impact  and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television Please let it be the final instalment  this bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original 1978 introduction to Myers et al Okay seriously when is the real Halloween Ends be released What I saw for the bulk was some lame

persuaders either Bautista is quite good here as is Aldridge and for a while the plot is actually quite intriguing The ultimate catch22 with a question posed to rational people  who love each other  that would test any of us Sadly though M Night Shyamalan cant keep the intrigue sustained and it rather runs out of steam from the middle onwards Groff doesnt really show up and neither for that matter does Rupert Grint I also felt that young Cui takes a little too much screen time and grates after a while Its the shortest of short stories and might have worked better had it just been the hour with a tighter narrative and less meandering Still  it does ask a question that Im not sure I could answer either in their position  and I did quite enjoy watching it The tender sympathetic and desperate performances are what make _Knock at the Cabin_ worthwhile The psychological and horror aspects of the film are timid at best with the true identities of Leonard and his associates being obvious gruesome elements that you never see and an apocalypse that is a lackluster disaster overallrnrnIts not that _Knock at the Cabin_ is entirely bad its that it seems to actively know it could be

reviewrnhttpsboundingintocomicscom20230203knockatthecabinreviewawellactedblahpocalypse Knock at the Cabin is an interesting premise that has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and mystique but fails to land a satisfactory endingrnrnI was pleasantly surprised with the story structure The movie wastes no time throwing the audience into the conflict within the opening frames of the film This allowed for an increased focus on the main story while maintaining a decent pace The first act of the film is great as the audience is new to the story and the mystery is still fresh But slowly the plot starts to repeat the same beats resulting in a less engaging second act As the film draws to its conclusion its ending is incredibly predictable which slightly worked for me but may be divisive to a general audience I did enjoy the small flashbacks of the couples life It added much needed context without taking too much time away from the main story archrnrnThe acting in the film is overall good but there are some major characters that stand out from the rest of the cast Dave Bautista was excellent he had a very serious menacing presence but had a kind and gentle nature to him that begged the audience to trust him This was by far one of his more complex roles in his career and I think he did a great job Abby Quinn had probably my favorite performance of the film Her dramatic scenes were mesmerizing and really drew me in She had such subtle facial gestures that expressed a deep sense of fear and sadness with eyes that could tell a story by themselves It was superb Jonathan Groff was good although he really seems to be playing a similar style of character to all of his previous roles I was excited to see Rupert Grint but we do not really get to see enough of him as he is only in the films first act and when he is present barely talksrnrnCinematography was great There were some really interesting camera angles and shots that were classic from Shyamalan I thought he did a really good job of portraying the brutality of what was occurring without actually showing it Having it pan away from the action or it being just out frame gave the audience what they needed to know without directly seeing it It slightly added to the suspense of it all Although as a true horror fan I would have loved to see some gore There are some very corny sequences with terrible CGI that took me out of this movie But with a budget of only 20m I am not sure what more I could have asked forrnrnOverall there is a lot to like about Knock at the Cabin but it is missing multiple key elements that hold it back from being a Shyamalan instant classic Despite that I think it was an enjoyable watch that I recommend you check out in theatersrnrnScore 73 rnVerdict Good The concept is awful I

downrnrnFull review httpshubpagescomentertainmentTexasChainsawMassacre2022ReviewTearingtheFaceOffofaHorrorFranchise Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is a film I was looking forward to for a while although I wasnt sure why I had been very disappointed in the last couple additions to the TCM franchise so I knew it was very likely that it would not be any different with this one I watched the film the day it came out and received exactly what I expected I didnt like it I liked it more than I expected yes but still not enough The acting was lacking the premise was stupid and it killed off the beloved legacy character in the most insulting way possible The only redeeming aspects of the movie are the nicelooking cinematography and the amazing gore However I am looking forward to seeing the next one and I have no idea why 355 The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually predated the original Halloween by four years but now its the formers turn to follow in the footsteps of the latter resulting in a case of the blind leading the blind This new Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes its cues from the recent Halloween and Halloween Kills going as far as dusting off the franchises original Final Girl  the character that is Marilyn Burns the actress who played the first Sally Hardesty died in 2014 and she certainly is in a better place now ie not in this moviernrnGenerally speaking though the only thing that separates this from pretty much every slasher film ever made is that instead of the usual Dead Teenager Movie Massacre 22 may very well be the firstever Dead Millennial Movie Speaking of which the kills which have the power to save even the most generic and derivative of horror sequels are another disappointment only the first one involving a very creative use of the bone shard sticking out of a compound fracture shows any ingenuityrnrnThe best thing that can be said of this uninspired effort is that its short shorter still considering that about 10 of its 81 minutes are devoted to the closing credits then again any movie is bound to be brief that lacks a proper conclusion  and Im not referring to the fact that when Sally who has been hunting Leatherface down for more than 30 40 years finally has him cornered she apparently decides all of a sudden that after having waited multiple decades for this moment she might as well wait a bit longer after all whats another five more minutes between old friends This is excruciatingly stupid but if the movie ended there it wouldnt be any more unsatisfying than the actual endingrnrnAnd the worst that can be said of TCM 22 is that it has the gall to draw a parallel between the titular chainsaw massacre and a high school shooting Stonebrook High which sounds very uncomfortably like Stoneman Douglas High School as if a dumb movie that deals in gratuitous violence and doesnt even have the decency to provide a cathartic resolution could ever find a way to connect emotionally to the victims of a reallife massacre This is low even by exploitation cinemas substandards Found out that Elsie Fisher and I were born exactly one year apart weirdrnrnCool movie though The reluctant Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise gets yet another rebootreimaginingsequel but this time they go the HalloweenKillsEnds route and bring back a surviving character from the original film  Things dont work out as well here as they did for the Halloween seriesrnrnFour idealistic or naive friends purchase a ghost town in Texas  They plan on renovating the entire town and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world  Sisters Melody Sarah Yarkin and Lila Elsie Fisher and couple Dante Jacob Latimore and Ruth Nell Hudson have runins with local law enforcement and some town hangerson with the film makers casting aspersions immediately the Gen Zmillenials are portrayed as wideeyed and woke while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling guntoting racists  Lila was injured in a school shooting and Melody hovers over her constantly  The group hear the tale of Leatherface from the 1974 original film and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film Sally Olwen Fouere taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as unsolved  The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors and find that an old lady Alice Krige and her adopted son Mark Burnham are still living in an abandoned orphanage  The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man Richter Moe Dunford who doesnt take to the group  Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance theres a lot of questions throughout and the carnage beginsrnrnThe timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise  The film is barely over eighty minutes long so there isnt a lot of character development or legacy building although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there  The script tries to inject something different into its story addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it  Garcias direction works with well with the films editing and this is a tightly shot flick although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state Im a fourth generation born Texan and know my birth state pretty wellrnrnThe problem here is of course the script  Characters not only make bad decisions they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed  While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didnt the movie would be even shorter  The gore and violence is over the top and I was very surprised that it got an R rating  The special effects are very well done but also very convincing to the point that this isnt a fun horror film  Terrifier was also a gory slasherhorror film but it had tension and suspense  Texas Chainsaw Massacre has little tension and viewers asking aloud why did they just do that instead  One setpiece on a bus was probably set up as the beall endall of gruesome mass murder but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium  In this day and age its sad that weve become so numb this is considered entertainment to be enjoyed again and again considering that the original film aside from one of the greatest titles of alltime wasnt as gory as you would expectrnrnI think its okay to finally put this franchise to rest it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous prerelease screenings so dont look for it on physical media anytime soon  I didnt hate it as much as some viewers

narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating At least these are the common complaints across his filmography While I acknowledge that these attributes dont always work Im actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur Legend of the Sword I genuinely enjoy Ritchies risky divisive approach on the best way to tell a storyrnrnGoing in completely blind to Wrath of Man I honestly didnt have a good feeling I expected a generic hollow forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV Well this movie might be 2021s best surprise to date If Zack Snyder Zack Snyders Justice League is often criticized for his excessive use of slowmotion Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his highspeed action scenes This time the latter leaves his wellknown characteristics aside and proves that hes not a onetrick filmmakerrnrnImpressively long uncut takes  some reach the threeminute mark  help create a tremendously tense suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audiences attention Christopher Bensteads score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent Some of you might read the following as a critique but the buildups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latterrnrnWith that said the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and wellfilmed which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators Jason Statham The Meg Hobbs  Shaw delivers a onedimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie but it works for this protagonist The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything so its only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion  even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues Furthermore its Jason Statham moviegoers go see his films for his action skills not his acting chops When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as himrnrnStorywise Ritchie didnt let go of his favorite narrative structure Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy Fortunately Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development with the focus going completely into the protagonists mission whatever that may bernrnWrath of Man isnt a groundbreaking mindblowing or even innovative action movie but its still one of the biggest best surprises of the year While its true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful onetake buildups to energetic riveting action sequences Jason Stathams onedimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed Christopher Bensteads score tremendously elevates the entire movie establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary ending with an ironically abrupt last scene contradicting the overall steady pacing In the end its a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possiblernrnRating B Huge Jason Statham fan But despite the trailer this movie was far from his greatest Hes his usual cool self but the story is weak and performance from Josh Hartnett is downright embarrassing to say the least Holt McCallany is decent but in general the characters come off as twodimensional You really dont care about them I panicked when I saw Jeffrey Donovan because his appearance is seldom that impressive He was okay though far from the one to blame for this Bmovie Its not bad but certainly not a masterpiece either Viewers who like action films with plenty of violence for the sake of having violence will love this movie I cant deny that the action grabs you by the throat and moves you along with it Sometimes however it felt to me like instead of a storyboard they worked from a murderboard Okay how many do we lose in this scene  Once again I am reminded of Hitchcock Suspense is not a bomb going off suspense is not knowing when or if it will explodernrnThey took a bit of trouble to make the plot seem more intricate than it was having maybe three flashbacks do the work of one for example Some of that layering of plot could have been diverted to character building and development Only our hero is given motivation and a back story and there are even gaps in thatrnrnBut it should be remembered that these observations are by and for someone who is not a fan of action films If you are a fan then nothing I have written here should deter you from watching Wrath of Man Brazen Brutal  BLOODY  Smart Sleek  STYLISH  But Was It  INSPIRING   Uplifting Or Even  Particularly   REMARKABLE    Im Afraid The Answer Is  NO   rnrnA Good Old Fashioned   _B I G_   Screen Mini Review rnrn Wrath Of Man is more violent more gritty than  Any  of my other films    Director Guy Ritchie from an official Entertainment Access featurette   So there it is the man himself saying it  Exactly  like it is And gritty could not have been a more  Apt  choice of words because if youre expecting any exceptionally lavish or Mindblowing setpieces from this particular cinematic endeavour then I ask you not to hold your breath in earnest And that is because      with the  sole  exception of the very fleeting   solitary   StaplesCenter  Shot   that also showcases a few quintessentially glitterey night time downtown Los Angeles high rises  and Is indeed inallfairness Dazzlingly Spectacular from a cinematographic standpoint atleast  No spoilers here  the said scene is proudly embellished in one of Mgms official trailers       in a nutshell  there actually  Arent  any  rnrnAnd in as much as the violent part of the  otherwise  highly accomplished Mr Ritchies brief yet pointed statement is concerned my earnest advice to you is quite simply as follows Keep any and all minors  in Your care  away from this Dark dark red  Adult  crime thriller    And with a 13foot pole at that at the very Least   Digging a tad deeper    note that the trailer shows a Seething  yet outwardly supercalm  H played by action terastar Jason Statham just   blowing people away  ie straight up Murdering them with his pistol in other words  willynilly Well one might have thought that following the coldblooded murder of his son  trailer also  by the  Exact  sort of people as himself  namely  potentially  Deadly calculated  ruthless armed robbers     the primary writer Éric Besnard might Perhaps have made a little More room for soul searching by H in the story Regrettably however that is to a Large extent  Not  the case here  rnrnSummation  So what is Wrath Of Mans  MORAL IMPERATIVE  then you ask Sadly I reply for the most part there  _IS_  None If youre at all familiar with my reviews then you would know that I  Rarely  say that a movie is just Pure Commerce with no clear  present Inspiring  or even just Redeeming  quality about it but Im afraid that in the case of this admittedly enthralling yet ultimately unremarkable picture  I would indeed be remiss to say that as best as I can tell atleast that is evidently  Not  the case A clear minded Honesttogoodness 0625 out of 1000 from me  At Best  u200d  Wrath of man Has all any action movie needs A plot of intrigue and mystery with a angry person looking for revenge honestly did not expect the movie to be good but it came out brilliantly A man just trying getting justice for what he felt is right The movie keeps u glued and dont lose interest Overall good movie Solid revengethriller with the usual badass performance from Jason Statham Doesnt exactly have the flare of the usual Guy Richie film but little touches here and there The pacing feels a tad off probably because it switches from Hs Statham POV to that of the robbers who really didnt do much for me Still well worth checking out 3755 If you want an evil militant and criminal drama at the same time then you will get everything at once and even more Just consider that the Wrath of Man is not only about shooting and unrestrained actionrnIf someone from friends ask me to advise a good thriller I would recommend the Wrath of Man along with other movies of Guy Ritchie Definitely Guy Ritchies best in quite a while Also nice to see a director take his Disney dollars and return to making something originalrnrnIs it a great film Not really But its really well crafted the story is interestingly told and it rekindles the vibe that made Ritchie the UKs version of Tarantino when he first emerged rnrnMy only complaint isnt necessarily about this film specifically but more its type by which I mean its yet another film about a guy with a secret badass background who goes on a revenge spree John Wick Taken Nobody The Equalizer and so many others have done the same thing Apparently bullets dont do permanent damage to lead characters Seriously with the damage he takes in this film he should have spent the runtime changing a colostomy bag and being wheeled to the TV to watch cartoons while drooling down his chest But again thats not unique to this film Its kinda the standard now days I guess when so many films seem to have the intention of being a franchise a characters mortality only becomes an issue if the actor doesnt renew their contract rnrnIf you dont mind this issue its a really fun film I enjoyed it a lot Im just getting tired of invincible heroes in films I am quite a fan of Jason Statham so I am perhaps a bit biased when it comes to movies he is in but to me this was a great action thriller I very much like Statham playing the silent mysterious tough guy role He is perfect in this rolernrnThe movie builds up somewhat slowly but it does not take very long before Statham shows that he is not an ordinary security guy when he takes down some wannabe robbers with nothing less than extreme efficiency A very cool scenernrnOn one side I like that the movie takes some time to build up the suspense and reveal the plot In articular why Statham is there in the first place On the other side the way the movie does it irks me somewhat There just to much flashbacks for my taste and some events we are forced to watch from no less than three different perspectives Felt a bit like a filler to me Still Stathams passed and presents weaves together in a story that to me is quite good and not the everyday run of the mill revenge story Quite well done actuallyrnrnNot entirely surprising the movie builds up to a big showdown in the end I very much liked it Lots of action although I would have liked that they let a few more of the good guys actually survive The death count on both sides was somewhat excessivernrnThe ending was satisfactory although from a point in the showdown about twenty or minutes from the end it was rather predictablernrnThe reason this movie gets four and a half or 9 out of 10 stars instead of the full five out of five is only because of the flash backs which Some of them contributed to the movie but some of them actually bored me a bit', NOW());

great details that it is still a joy to watch There are so many interesting shots that leave the viewer questioning what reality is Although that can lead to a bit of confusion I was still able to keep up with the ideas presented The acting in this film was amazing all around I really enjoyed Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård performances The romantic relationship between Alexander Skarsgård and Anya TaylorJoy did feel a little half baked and underdeveloped though The action in this movie is few and far between but when it does peak its head out it in brutal and visceral leaving audiences gasping at the bloody details and gore The action was done really well with not many cuts and incredible choreography Overall this film was really great and I wish I would have watched it in the theatersrnrnScore _87_rnVerdict _Excellent_ So so so so bad Spare yourselfrnrnI feel like Im taking crazy pills I keep reading all these reviews that claim this movie is gruesomely violent actionpacked and wellpaced Did we see the same movie This movie was the furthest from those three things The Northam is dreadfully slow with hardly anything happening and when the few action scenes did happen they were very poorly done The only cool part was him catching and throwing back the spear and I saw that in the trailer I will say that the visuals and atmosphere of the movie were super well done but that was it Do not waste your time MORE SPOILERFREE REVIEWS  httpswwwmsbreviewscomrnrnThe Northman boasts a brutal score worthy of the biggest blockbusters tremendously elevating a

bloodiest murders in the famous saga the directors Matt BettinelliOlpin Tyler Gillett and writers James Vanderbilt Guy Busick pay a beautiful homage to the influential creator Wes CravenrnrnThe whole cast  both newcomers and icons  delivers remarkable performances portraying characters who unapologetically address admittedly cinephiledriven topics that some occasional moviegoers might not fully

fluctuating factors of entertainment Ill see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it I know this new installment was successful 884 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing and some enjoyed it but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchisernrnThis new film feels like its trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing This is something the film addresses but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab woundsrnrnFull review httpshubpagescomentertainmentScream2022ReviewMoviesMakePsychosMoreImitative Decent movie with a nice balance of meta  references to the original without overdoing it Okay addition to the franchise has some good kills and the acting at least was serviceable and nice seeing the legacy characters again The killers motivations did feel a bit 5 years ago to me though I dont do reddit or really other social media platforms but fine I guess and similar to the social commentary from Scream 4 Id rank this third in the franchise I suppose behind the original and Scream 2 for all that movies flaws it has a soft spot for me Not great but worth watching once 3255 Scream is a selfaware thriller that doesnt try to be more than it is The kills are great the violence is there and the comedy is good enough that is doesnt take away from the moviernrnVerdict _Good_ Ive watched every scream since scream was invented I like the first two okay but after that the kind of got a little iffy This one really goes back to what screen was intended to be by Wes Craven I really like the flow of this movie and how they put the twist on Samanthas character It starts like the first scream and it ends like the first scream Ill have to say out of all the scream movies this was one of the most decent and hardest to figure out One of the best slasher flicks since 1996rnrnI loved the first Scream  the surprise the shock the selfawareness the humor It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality And this newest one is the best since the first It captured all the fun of the first It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall  naturally that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream Playing with the tropes in a fun selfaware way is what Scream is all about and Matt BettinelliOlpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it Some things never change This can be good and also bad Bad like Audibly Sharp knives ie blades that make a sharpening noise when being whisked through thin air or like when former deputy Dewey Riley David Arquette says You have to shoot em in the head or they always come back Of course the very existence of the new Scream is irrefutable proof that they will come back regardless This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one in addition to revisiting this particular franchise it borrows a key plot point from Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare  that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are like me a student of the genrernrnAll of the above notwithstanding Scream 22 is overall more good than bad True to its roots this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema Specifically it is a textbook example of a requel  like the last couple of Halloweens or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre  and by textbook I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes which I call Chekhovs InhalerrnrnI just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but the fact is that Scream 22 comes to join the much better company of Wes Cravens New Nightmare and last years Candyman suitably the movie is dedicated to Cravens memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout This Screams oftrepeated mantra is always go back to the original and thats sage advice because like Nightmare on Elm Street this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking mans horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry  unlike say Friday the 13th which was born stupidrnrnThankfully this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material and who dont underestimate the audiences intelligence Consequently when characters send text messages the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens and when a someone is stabbed they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels and in an age where CGI is the norm any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact I will only add that also like New Nightmare and Candyman 21 Scream 22 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell so heres hoping that it will live up to its promise that After tonight no more books no more movies no more fing Ghostface', NOW());

present day Renfield Nicholas Hoult is the tortured loyal assistant to Dracula Cage Hes served his master for decades taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner After centuries of servitude Renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his ownrnrnAlthough it is mostly dead in the water the films pacing never feels slow Theres plenty of entertainment its just not fun enough outrageous enough nor twisted enough The tone is both tongueincheek and sincere which is not cohesive as a whole Theres a lot of action that means nothing and characters like Awkwafinas police officer that are bland and forgettablernrnThe side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss Shohreh Aghdashloo and her son Ben Schwartz that wants

on paper but are poorly executed across the board Thats why the movie feels so underwhelmingrnrnCage is by far the best part of this mess and he is an actor who is born to play Dracula He hams it up in every scene and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy His manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like Hail Satan is absolute blissrnrnThe blood and gore is overthetop and mostly used in a humorous manner but this isnt for the squeamish There is graphic throat ripping spurting blood and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out McKay

expecting a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettablernrnThe screenplay is really all over the place There are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film Dracula Awkwafinas subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere I felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on Renfield and

nothing that really blew me awayrnrnThe direction was pretty poor So many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what

apparently bad The gore was at an extreme but for the love of God why did they choose to use CGI blood The graphics literally looked like something out of a PS2 Mortal Kombat absolutely terrible Which

predictable plotrnrnOverall I had a great time with this film and the theater experience was one of my favorites of the year The plot is somewhat similar to the first a murder happens and Benolt Blanc is there to solve it It hits all the familiar beats but does not work quite as well as its predecessor this is mainly due to the characters The performances were great and they work well in isolation from the overarching story but all of them are such overthetop caricatures that are hard to believe their connections or motivations to kill Their banter with each other is charming and funny and helps carry this movie forwardrnrnThe first quarter of this movie was pretty poorly done A lot of the setup had pandemic references and humor that felt really out of place in 2022 So many movies before this have touched on those topics that it felt overdone and boring Really interesting choice for this type of film but once the characters get to the island all of that awkward setup is left on the mainland and the movie starts to find its footingrnrnFrom this point forward I had a great time Daniel Craig was fantastic as Benolt Blanc and it was quite funny to see him as a fish out of water surrounded by corporate elites The majority of the lines I laughed at were delivered by him with a dry pan sense of delivery It was organic and played well on screen Edward Norton was a fantastic addition and the majority of the cast did excellently They were really funny and delivered the stereotyped character performances wellrnrnMuch like the beginning of the movie the last ten minutes did not work tremendously well for me It was quite corny over the top and unrealistic It diminishes the greatness of the middle of the filmrnrnEven though this movie fails to reach the heights of the original it does enough to deliver a very entertaining mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed It is a shame that Netflix is only having a limited release for this film because it is best in a crowded theater on the silver screenrnrnScore _77_  rnVerdict _Great_ Daniel Craig rather engagingly reprises his role as the Poirotesque Benoit Blanc in this fairly unashamed ripoff of all things Agatha Christie He finds himself an unexpected guest of billionaire Bron Edward Norton on his beautiful Greek island amongst a slew of other notables who  of course  each have an axe to grind with this outwardly affable host The purpose of the gettogether is a traditional murder mystery and after an hearty dinner it will fall on the other guests to discover who has murdered Bron Well thats the plan anyway  but of course it doesnt take long for all of that to be derailed and for us to become embroiled in lots of concentric plots and tales of betrayal and duplicity that will truly test the mettle of our sleuth and the audience The assembled cast provide for a myriad of characterisations and as we discover an equally fertile source for suspicion and comedy Kate Hudson is good fun as the nicebutdim Birdie Dave Bautista keeps more than youd think is his budgiesmugglers and Jackie Hoffman steals the show in the very few scenes she graces as his nonnonsense mother The writing delivers a multilayered feast  some of it basic and bawdy some more sophisticated as the story gradually progresses towards a conclusion that navigates the red herrings before a denouement that wasnt quite what I was expecting It looks really good and it takes a swing at just about everything from corporate greed vanity vacuousness and stupidity  but it does it in a satisfyingly subtle fashion Though rather slow to get off the ground once it gets up and running its a good watch Glass Onion lives up to the expectations and spirit established by Knives Out but doesnt bring anything new to a growing franchisernrnGlass Onion is a fun followup to Knives Out that captures all the character and energy of its predecessor While I enjoyed the original more Glass Onion was still very entertaining The powerhouse cast ensured that every character exploded to life through the excellent portrayals of Glass Onions brilliantly chosen stars Each role felt tailormade to the actor cast for it The group of entitled celebrities felt more wild and uncontrollable than the frustrated family of Knives Out which raised Glass Onions peril and unpredictability Glass Onion brilliantly hid clues throughout the film that reveal the murderer if the audience is paying attention Its a great whodunit but I would like more development of Daniel Craigs Benoit Blanc His character didnt get much more backstory or growth over the last film and even felt sidelined for the movies second half I wanted just a little more for Blanc but I look forward to the next installment of this fantasy franchise MORE SPOILERFREE

control over its clear yet repetitive message concerning opportunism vanity and hypocrisyrnrnOriginal remains supreme but this sequel deserved a worldwide premiere on the big screenrnrnRating B BrilliantrnrnMy first film of 2023 which has started with a bang I adore the original film from 2019 so was expecting big things from this sequel and Im glad to note that it didnt disappoint  its a cracker I did admittedly predict the general gist of what was going to happen though in this case minor predictability doesnt always equel badness  like here I was thoroughly entertained no matter whatrnrnThe cast from the first film are better though those that star in this 2022 release are excellent Daniel Craig is of course superb as Benoit Blanc once again every single moment with him is terrific Janelle Monáe also gives a fantastic performance I predominantly know of her from music but with this and ema hrefhttpsletterboxdcomfilmhiddenfiguresHidden Figuresaem she can certainly act toornrnKate Hudson Dave Bautista and Edward Norton are the best of the others though even the likes of Kathryn Hahn Leslie Odom Jr and Madelyn Cline are good value as well Like its predecessor its very astutely castrnrnThe film is put together in high quality fashion Rian Johnson  Co did a great job  particularly with the framing of certain shots as well as the music which is real neat As youd expect for a film of this sort there are some nice little details spread across the well utilised run time Like emKnives Outem I know Ill be revisiting emGlass Onion A Knives Out Mysteryem when possiblernrnIt sounds like Johnson and Craig are up for making more of these and to that I say bring it on As with the first Knives Out movie I found the plot to be clever and intricate and the story very well told There were a few interesting plot twists and even though the dialogue could have been more witty it was intelligent and realisticrnrnI did find that the Renoir character reminded me of an Agatha Christie character in that he reeled off suppositions hed made based on information we hadnt been given full access to Also he owed some of his success to a character who he asked to take a snoop around and she proceeded to be in several spots just in time to hear critical details Pretty lucky Then again I write novels in my spare time and the subtitle of one of them is The Consequences of Coincidences And it features a few of them so I guess I shouldnt begrudge a few juicy coincidences in someone elses workrnrnUltimately the movie was enjoyable and smart and that is the most important thing Whats great about this is that within the first minute or so of meeting every cast member you are told who they are and what their motivation isrnrn so it leaves out the tedious who done it guess work of murder mysteriesrnrnAnd you are told almost from the start who the killer is and what his motivation isrnrn so you dont have the tedious guess work there eitherrnrnBut to keep you on your toes scenes are conveniently rewritten several ways to make it seem like a mystery even though the mystery aspect has been conveniently taken out for todays low IQ audiencesrnrnThe viewer conveniently doesnt have to uncover anything nor try to determine any motivation and all the clues are obvious and handed to you by virtue of Bond stumbling onto them in a way that leaves the viewer in no doubt despite already knowing who the killer is and what his motivation wasrnrnBut its Johnson so people can pretend to be intelligent by claiming that he diverted expectations of a murder mystery by taking all the thought and mystery out of it and leaving you with the obvious that has been obviously stated for todays modern audiencernrnBut it does hit all the political check boxes the ones that literally every other title hits per mandate of cancel culture So the faux intellectuals can further proclaim how smart and original it is while having it nicely fit into the same box as everything else Almost everything is already told and you know who the killer is rnMoreover I hate when they put Covid into movies We already lived two years full of stupid restrictions and this film is like if its trying to sayehy be a good ship and do as its told you to do all this topped off with Google and Apple advertising Glass Onion A Knives out Mystery is a thoroughly entertaining well crafted thrilling step up from its predecessor  Knives Outxa0rnrnBenoit Blanc  Daniel Craig  returns as the World Famous detective who unintentionally has been invited to a private island by the host of a murder mystery party Myles Bronn  Edward Norton There is palpable tension within the select group of party guests well before proceedings begin but after a real murder Benoit Blanc is called upon to solve the casexa0rnrnWithout giving anything away Glass Onion twists and turns as it builds to both a fascinating and hilarious whodunnit while exploring themes of class and privilege Daniel Craig gives an hilarious performance as The detective with Edward Norton giving an equally strong performance as the manipulative Elon Musk esc characterrnrnGlass Onion provides surprises suspense and laughs in equal measure delivering a fast paced comic mystery With a well known cast and a few notable cameos including the late Angela Lansbury as one of Benoit Blancs zoom quiz friends group  Glass Onion delivers everything anyone could desire from a film like this Theres nothing spectacularly brilliant about the film except that the mystery is a pure pleasure to watch The cast and technical aspects are great And while the film is dedicated for one to Angela Lansbury author of longrunning Murder She Wrote the detective here is clearly Dame Agatha Christies The closing credits also say that its dedicated to Stephen Sondheim whose connection escapes me other than he died just before the film was made and perhaps too that his music is typically complicated layers  like onions A childish scenario that prevented me from participating in determining who the killer wasrnrnThe first part was dazzling and surprising for those who watched the movie and the fans of movie type of Who is the killer The first part presented a group of wellknown stars in a different format than the roles they played in previous acting worksrnrnIn the second part I face many challenges Will the second part be better than the first part or at least equal to it Secondly yes it presents us with a group of stars with beautiful charisma on the screenrnrnThis time the events of the film take place during the pandemic This time the main investigator the hero of the story is facing deadly boredom due to him staying at home all the time due to the pandemic and the lockdown This is what drives him without hesitation to participate in one of the games organized by a rich person This game is to solve a crime hypothetically a crime that didnt happen in reality This invitation reaches the investigator and some close friends of this rich person but during their arrival to the place of the invitation we begin to discover many mysterious thingsrnrnThe first is how the friends get to know each other Each character is completely different from the other character a rich person a YouTuber model a scientist in addition to a political figure and an investigator We begin to discover by starting the conversation from the beginning that there is a suspicious or unhealthy past for each character but the most important thing is that it is far from the game and the hypothetical investigation We begin to discover real crimes in the place of AlDaghwa and now everyone is a suspect and through the story we will learn who the culprit isrnrnYes I am almost certain that the characters of the second part will continue on the same path as the movie of the first part What I did not like about this movie Yes they showed us the motives and reasons but I could not get behind any motive in them and in these types of stories the most beautiful thing is that it shows that you made a mistake about who the murderer is not Only in deceiving you but showing you that your deductions were wrong makes you doubt one or two or three people and in the end you discover that all your doubts were wrong In this part I was not able to doubt anyonernrnYes it is true there are many good plots in the scenario and there is good manipulation but I cannot be certain that I doubt any character as if I was waiting and seeing the events for the vision to appear I could not participate in the game which is very important in this type of movie In addition to clarifying things there were many coincidences to the point of being so ridiculous The only reason some mysteries and some indicators were discovered is that the character for some reason was present at the right time and the right place without any actual intelligence to find the informationrnrnI dont know I feel that my feelings were confused towards the end of the movie I would almost describe it as childish ending the actions of some characters led to the flattening of this movie The first part was so amazing that it cannot be described', NOW());

slaughter of James Thats quite intriguing but the rest of this recycles that theory as an increasingly debauched and unentertaining series of scenarios are played out in front of us presumably in order to illustrate a range of human frailties and issues with confidence and selfbelief There is one rather amusing scene with Goth on the bonnet of her car towards the end but the remainder of this is just a rather messy drug infused meander of a story that left me wondering why it went on for almost two hours At times the writing is quite smart but all too infrequently to sustain this thinnest of stories and by midway through I could honestly say that I couldnt have cared less about any of them  even if Skarsgård does have a nice ass I suspect you will either love or hate this there were

world of threat and danger It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless But the success of the film lies with the lead actor Daisy EdgarJones a very talented Brit who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television NORMAL PEOPLE There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which in turn captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production For a swamp girl living off the grid her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment I would definitely see this film again and am tempted to buy the audible book I give this film an enthusiastic 9 beautiful and touching out of 10 Drama Daisy EdgarJones is really quite good in this adaptation of the Delia Owens story of a young girl left to her own devices in 1950s America One by one her mother siblings and finally her father abandon her to bring herself up She takes to fishing for mussels in order to try to make ends meet and is generally shunned by her community Except that is for her childhood friend Tate a good effort too from Taylor John Smith but when he leaves to go to college she is exposed to the local Lothario Chase Harris Dickinson Turns out he is a bit of a wrong un for her and when he is found dead at the bottom of a fire tower she is prime suspect What now ensues is a trial that provides us with retrospectives of the girls childhood and her relationships whilst Milton David Strathairn organises her defence for a crime that might not even have been committed The cinematography is gorgeous the remoteness and intimacy of her existence is captured really well as is the sense of isolation from her community as they look upon her as little more than an urchin Smith portrays a decency to his character he reminded me a lot of Joe Alwyn and there are some touching performances from Sterling Macer Jnr and Michael Hyatt as the closest thing the young girl has to family Dickinsons accent is all over the shop but he does manage to convince well enough as the rather duplicitous man who probably deserved his fate  however it actually happened It is an interesting story illustrating just how little by way of state infrastructure or interference there was in this young girls life and how that empowered and endangered her in equal measure DEJ delivers a strong and nuanced performance as the initially illiterate girl who was determined not be put upon and the story has a redemption that I found really fitting The photography really does benefit from a cinema screen if you can Split opinion on this Overall though I think my thoughts regarding it are just narrowly positivernrnemWhere the Crawdads Singem is a tad overlong and Im not sold on the ending though even so I think I like this enough The acting is the big reason for that with Daisy EdgarJones standing out alongside David Strathairn Taylor John Smith and Garret Dillahunt are solid

you The only Other cinematic experience Ive had where a film came FullCircle in Such beautiful fashion in Recent memory at least would be the simply Fabulous SpiderMan No Way Home  SMNWH  It is a picture that literally  And Very Cleverly  ties up loose ends within the  Entire  Spiderman CANON of films from as far back as 2002 It also just happens to be the Last Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed  before going on an Entirely unplanned  but Incredibly refreshing  Extended 101day hiatus from reviewingrnrnOk so if you thought that the 13 yr old Newcomer of said film pintsized thespian  Walker Scobell was a tremendous Dramatic actor well then youd only be Half right The fact of the mater is hes also a terrific COMEDIC talent with seriously Impeccable timing especially given that this is get this his  First Ever  movie or TV  Feature  appearance Factor Walkers SuperFun performance in alongside a full spectrum of absolute  POWERHOUSE  deliveries from the films unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists  Zoe Saldaña Ryan Reynolds Mark Ruffalo Jennifer Garner      then add in some absolutely Fantastic   truly state of the art  CGI a genuinely Mindblowing grand finale set piece and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to See to believe     you have a seriously seriously exciting picture indeedrnrnNot to mention FUNNY AS HELL I really hadnt laughed so hard in a long time  since  about the 3rd time  I watched SMNWH to be precise On the downside though     if Im to be painfully honest    Both the Villain  dont get me wrong the person who plays the main baddie is a Veteran performer  I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that Little Bit Stronger  And her ever loyal henchman are a tad weak as is the very title of the film itself Even something as  relatively  simple as FLASHBACKFORWARD would have been  Far  catchier than its existing name  although I do think I sorta understand Why they called it what they did for what its worth  Its for these two reasons Alone that I Didnt give it my trademark 2510  reserved especially for movies That Move Me  VERY  Deeply as TAP  quite obviously  DidrnrnSummary This is a picture that

Estranged FatherSon Relationships the world over but most especially in the USA   where the film is also Set   and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels what with the

_The Adam Project_ finds a way to pave its own path to deliver a fun and heartwarming story about selfforgiveness The movie starts incredibly strong introducing the viewer to the main characters The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic and feels really genuine creating an instant connection between the two and the audience Walker Scobell does an excellent job doing his best Ryan Reynolds impersonation making me really buy into the fact that they are the same character This pace carries on up until the second act when characters and lore are being thrown at the viewer left and right This section feels incredibly rushed resulting in the viewer having very little emotional connection with the ideas introduced Zoe Saldana and Mark Ruffalo do a fantastic job with the limited screen time that they have it was great seeing them outside of their standard CGI suits looking at you Marvel The antagonist wore her welcome towards the end of the film as her antics seemed a little forced The comedy in this movie was done fairly well I enjoyed the fast sarcastic nature of the boy and his back and forth with Reynolds but some jokes did fall flat But that is par for the course in any comedy Overall this film was enjoyable and even though it had its faults I appreciated the concepts it deliveredrnrnVerdict _Good_ Overall  Its sincere story results in one of Netflixs better original moviesrnrnA surprisingly heartfelt film that shocked me with how well it made me care for each of its characters I watched this movie with low expectations due to Netflixs disappointing track record of mediocre original movies Each actor felt typecast into roles they had played before but still delivered meaningful performances The effects and production were fairly typical of a Netflix project But even though I cant say each specific part of The Adam Project was particularly remarkable the sum of all its parts was fantastic The writing mixed with the casts solid performances just equals something great The standout by far was Walker Scobells excellent portrayal of young Ryan Reynolds Ruffalo says old bean good stuff If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree thoughts please follow my blog

performance  finally portraying a noncaricatured role of himself  and Shawn Levy steers the story through energetic fastpaced action sequences The filmmaker both plays and takes advantage of the cliches from timetravel moviesrnrnUltimately its harmless silly fun with a touch of scifi for any viewer to enjoyrnrnRating B A satisfactory flick featuring Ryan ReynoldsrnrnI got enough enjoyment from emThe Adam Projectem It isnt anything special as the film is missing a certain sort of spark to it though the story is fun and allows for some interesting and rather sweet scenes the latter is

moments for him across the 100 or so minutes Walker Scobell gives a good showing behind the main man his comedic timing in the first few scenes really does mirror ReynoldsrnrnElsewhere on the cast

former stunt coordinator  similar to how Chad Stahelski progressed to the directors role for the John Wick series  increases the action another notch compared to the first moviernrnThe highlight is a 21minute long take It has impressive choreography to make it look chaotic but it must have been very well organised with the number of people and different weapons used throughout There is closequarters handtohand combat a sprawling prisonyard brawl a decent car chase with multiple different vehicles and big crashes and finally a sequence on a fastmoving cargo train with helicopters and more confined fighting Each segment would be good as a standalone action setpiece but this is stitched together to form a highoctane breathless nonstop survival and escape sequencernrnThe movie boasts high production values and a storyline that humanises a lot of the characters  something a lot of dumb action movies ignore Nothing quite compares to the first act There is a rather clinical street shootout which is the least creative but does get interesting when theyre stuck inside the building The intimate faceoff at the end goes against the grain of a typical action movie structure and provides a decent conclusionrnrnIts a fun movie to enjoy with impressive and inventive sequences If you like action movies youll love this I am looking forward to what they can achieve in a third

far more bland Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt try their best but apart from the climactic ending that delivers one of the best visual executions of an asteroid colliding with a planet in recent years there isnt a single memorable aspect in this movie thats part of an already packed subgenre with many stories worthy of more attention A dinosaur flick this uninteresting should be considered a cinephilic crimernrnRating D Mills Adam Driver undertakes a long space mission so he can earn enough money for his poorly daughter to have lifesaving treatment Along the route their ship encounters an uncharted meteor storm and next thing he knows he is marooned on a distinctly hostile planet with the only other survivor  the feisty young Koa Ariana Greenblatt for company Their only hope is to reach a distant part of their wrecked mother ship in which there is an escape module that can propel them back into space where they might be rescued Snag Well they are not the only living creatures on this world  and without exception the others all want Mills and Koa sandwiches for lunch and  wait for it  there is a great big meteor on a collision course with the planet that is going to have an existential impact on their surroundings What now ensues is a rather predictable series of Jurassic Park style adventures that offer the visual effects folks a chance to shine but little else Driver is completely unremarkable here the escapades have little  or no  jeopardy and I just kept thinking this was just a sort of dinosaurs do Degoba style of adventure I didnt hate it and it will be fine on the telly at Christmas  but as a big screen experience it is weak derivative and the star brings nothing at all to the party This review does contain spoilersrnrnrnrnrnrnrnrnrnrnSuch a disappointing movie Adam Driver is a great actor but this movie is so incredible boring 90 of the movie are encounters to another and then another and then another dangerous blood seeking Dino Just when you think the story might get anywhere there is another Dino to shoot  Slowly you are realizing there is no more extra story it is just a short journey to a top of a hill fighting Dinos And Adam is a father of a 9 year old but then on this journey he has to do the journey with another 9 year old which looks too old and suddenly  becomes like the dumbest not able to communicate person in the world  Such a waist of actor talent and special effects money My guess is that the makers have cgi or vision art backgrounds because the only thing well done in this movie are the special effects This film starts out with an odd premise Putting a twist on the Planet of the Apes plot instead of earth astronauts ending up in the past or future of this planet the Earth is visited by space travelers from a different planet in the distant prehistoric past The title is not a suggested rating for reviewers but rather how many million years ago the story takes place So it is odd to contemplate that the Adam Driver character speaks Engish just so we can understand him while his costar speaks some other language How different the story would have been if we understood her Koa and not himrnrnBut I digress So this turns into another Jurassic Park without the huge body count or those magic sighing moments of viewing a herd of docile grazing Brontosauruses or triceratops Instead the dinosaurs start out as killing threats and remain so throughout I suppose this is also a good reason to show the movie on a streaming service rather than on a large theater screen That sort of access might have tilted the movie away from sciif thriller and towards mere horrorrnrnI had this weird and unrealized vision of them showing some sign of these alien visitors millions of years later along with other fossil remains but perhaps fortunately perhaps nothing like that developed Underneath poor pacing and a halfbaked plot there is a good film that unfortunately 65 never fully realizesrnrnFrom the start of the film the pacing was dreadful The introduction of our character Mills and the setup to his story were rushed and for no reason as the movie was under an hour and thirty minutes long This time that should have been used for character development and motivation setup was fastforwarded in order to get to the action on Earth This section is critical to the audiences ability to relate to Mills and unfortunately we never get to see it come to fruitionrnrnOnce we get to Earth things start to even out as the story progresses The world they built was breathtaking and the visuals were stellar The action set pieces were nothing too impressive but they did the job and had me thoroughly entertained But similarly to the introduction this section lacks heart 65 tries to be more than just a dinosaur action flick and attempts to develop an intimate relationship between Mills and Koa just dont work I think the decision to make them speak different languages really took away from their development It always felt awkward which is a missed opportunity for what they could have beenrnrnDespite my story complaints this movie was just entertaining There were some pretty decent action scenes Adam Driver was fantastic as always and the overall concept was pretty unique I loved the idea of this not being a time travel film especially with that mixed with the extinction event of the dinosaurs In the end this film is not good but it isnt as bad as many would have you believernrnScore 56rnVerdict Decent', NOW());

of offbeat storytelling appeals to Pitt  I get a flashback of Pitt in Twelve Monkeys embracing the lunacy   One might also see Tarantino in the storytelling as well  Most of the critics get it right though the execution is a little flat   What works however are the montages of the other assassins and their backstory  The entire production and I mean every single shot feels like it is from a graphic novel  Careful attention to glowing backlights from buttons or tv screens or fancy lighting in general makes this bristle with Japanese cityscape   In fact every shot of the Bullet train that goes from Tokyo to Kyoto which I have taken myself shows it as CGI cityscape  So the slick feel is done by using cutaway shots of the bullet train never leaving the city believe it our not in reality the train does go through some countryside as a punch point as some stunning event happens with the plot   rnrnSo this is a thriller and it tries to throw in some whodunnit of who killed who  It also adds tension as our protagonist does not know he is in possible danger while the audience has been clued in   I like the attempt to go against stereotypes with our main characters   That includes the rich adolescent daughter  Dressed innocently she actually has a cold heart   As for Brad Pitt he is a little too this all for fun and becomes a little too relaxed in a movie star going through the motions kind of way   Which I guarantee is not what Pitt is actually doing  I think he takes any role seriously and is acting out his character to the fullest   Its just that his character feels a but thin here  rnrnI felt the movie started off on the wrong foot with the banter between Pitt and his handler  As an editor I would trusted the audience to let Pitt enter the story without the on the nose exposition  I also think that a slightly more serious tone would not make the gratuitous violence feel so comic book   Therein lies the reason this movie exists in the first place John Wick  Audiences are expecting creative action sequences  and there are many set pieces that take advantage of being stuck on a train  Two other main characters are a lower class set of English assassins straight from Snatch   That movie depicted a good number of lower class criminals in England speaking goofy dialogue and taking part in some Three Stooges style of mishaps   The duo here spend the entire movie bickering finding their personal problems more interesting than our caper   I felt their schtick was pushed their names are Tangerine and Lemon and the expected humour didnt really connect with the audience  Which is too bad because they are essentially the main characters probably getting more screen time than Pitt  rnrnThe Japan setting worked very well although I expect that none of the film was actually shot in Japan except maybe one of the early establishing shots   The stylish production design necessitated lots of embellishments to the slick backgrounds that the real world cant match  Thats OK I appreciated how cool the movie looked as this convoluted world of Japanese but not Japanese criminals go after the Macguffin   That is although this a Japanese crime movie many of the key characters are not Japanese  rnrnAs for the action scenes they are serviceable with a mix of weapons and hand to hand fighting   However there is an annoying habit of victims dying and not dying   Those type of one twist too many issues prevent this movie from being a James Bond kind of generic thriller that delivers the goods   I just recently saw Gray Man and took note that although the story had nothing original to say it stayed to its core action tenets and didnt try to confuse the audience with any real twists   So even though both of these films are losers for the critics there still is a level of roller coaster ride mentality that makes a well made action yarn enjoyable  So I enjoyed this more than those recent lazy Fast and Furious films but found the story too convoluted even more than Gray Man  6 out of 10 I first got an extended look at Bullet Train during Cinemacon when a reel of the film was shown during the Sony showcase to an enthusiastic crowd The footage mixed action and humor with quirky and dysfunctional characters and became a mustsee film for me based on the teased footagernrnThe film is based on a book by Kotaro Isaka and stars Brad Pitt as an operative named Ladybug He is called at the last minute as a replacement and given instructions to board a Bullet Train and snatch a case in one of the passenger areas before exiting at the next stationrnrnHaving gone through a recent crisis Ladybug is awash in various philosophical and new age ideas as he attempts to find his inner peace and a new path in life as such he does not take a gun with him when he boards despite being instructed to do so by his handlerrnrnThe train is filled with various killers and dangerous people who are there to accomplish various goals and most of whom fail frequently in violent and hysterical manners which further complicate their agendas as well as that of the others and often puts them into conflict with one another as the story unfoldsrnrnIt would be difficult to go into further detail on the various characters without spoiling some of the reveals and twists along the way but suffice it to say that Aaron TaylorJohnson and Brian Tyree Henry as Tangerine and Lemon are great and their banter as well as capers is a frequent highlightrnrnThere are some surprise cameos in the film which add to the fun and Joey King is as great as

now zenlike semiretired hitman brought out of retirement to appropriate a suitcase from a train Easy enough task you might think  especially as he obtains it relatively easily It then transpires though that there is much more afoot Also on the train are the two guys who own the suitcase  Lemon Brian Tyree Henry and his twin Tangerine Aaron TaylorJohnson who have been tasked with rescuing the recently kidnapped son of the legendary White Death crime lord and his ransom in the suitcase When the pair discover that their loot has gone missing and that their charge has developed a rather nasty habit of bleeding from the eyes they have to keep their suspicious employer at bay and find their luggage whilst this highspeed train hurtles from Tokyo to Kyoto Add to the mix the slightly enigmatic Prince Joey King  outwardly a charming butterwouldntmelt schoolgirl type but really a gal who is also up to something with the rather hapless Kimura Andrew Kohi whose son she had recently pushed from a roof and well Yes the plot is pretty convoluted at the start but with a monologue style narrative well delivered by an onform Pitt and an engaging repartee between the Thomas the Tank Engine obsessed Lemon and his spiritual brother this actually makes for quite a decent action adventure It is way too long  it could comfortably shave twenty minutes from the character establishment phase but the script is quickly paced and sometimes quite clever and there are plenty of action scenes that are fun to watch and dont take too long It has shades of Pulp Fiction 1994 I thought  multiple characters with entertaining storylines that gradually involve and synergise all the characters The ending isnt the best and perhaps one might wonder about the complete lack of security not just on the train but at just about every station between the two cities Carnage ensues pretty readily but no sign of a blue light Its fun throwaway entertainment that follows on from The Lost City in which Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum allow Pitt the supporting role that he allows to both of them  and a tiny but of Ryan Reynolds too if you are eagleeyed here Its factory fodder and you wont remember

life and outrageous but all fit perfectly in this vivid and comical world Bullet Train feels like Edgar Wrights version of John Wick  all the action is there but so are all the comedy and quirky characters Brad Pitts prowess as an actor shines as his ridiculous peaceloving assassin blunders through the film but never crosses the line into cliche or too much Brian Tyree Henrys Lemon is the most entertaining out of a cast of enthusiastic overthetop characters that will have you laughing from the first second til the credits roll Funny cameos and great action punctuate this already fun and colorful film Bullet Train is a fun watch but some poor visual effects distract from the ending and keep the rating from being higher Even with its few faults Bullet Train is a goofy dynamic and bright action flick that invents a fun world I wouldnt mind exploring in future films A welltimed funny action packed train ride I was not bored for a single second of this film This was a fund movie indeed and quite wokefree at that The fact that the woke crap site Rotten Tomatoes has marked it as rotten despite it having more than 50 positive critics reviews was a good sign of coursernrnIt is an actioncomedy about an unbelievably unlucky and a bit stupid assassin played by Brad Pitt The movie mixes action comedy a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable packagernrnThe movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringeworthy but there was really only one place where I went Oh no what the frnrnThe action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous Like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds awayrnrnAlthough fairly unbelievable and over the top the core story actually makes some sense but then it was not written by some Hollywood hack but instead based on a novelrnrnOverall it was a fun movie with a lot of laughs The end twist with the tangerine truck was absolutely hilarious I see there are a LOT of reviews of Bullet Train here so I will be brief I usually only watch action movies if they contain a large element of humor and if possible an actor I like So I gave Bullet Train a try I figured Brad Pitt wouldnt get involved with a totally awful filmrnrnSo yes it was humorous and often entertaining with the comic book violence action films often seem to include I guess because the audience demands it I almost gave up on it halfway through not because it was boring but just because the story seemed so shallow and the subplots didnt grab me  But the films action moved along fast enough for me to stick with it Like I said it is entertaining in places and witty overall though I cant imagine ever watching it a second time By Louisa Moore  wwwScreenZealotscomrnrnIt takes a lot for a film to surprise me and I love it when one does Bullet Train is chocked full of so much stylish bloody violent fun that it reminds me why I love movies in the first place Director David Leitch brings a confident creative vision to his Guy RitchiemeetsGareth Evansmeets Matthew Vaughnmeets Quentin Tarantino style thats rambunctious frenzied and in your face While some will detest this sort of mayhem many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming shoot this into my

briefcase from a highspeed train in Japan which seems simple enough Fate steps in naturally putting a damper on his wellintentioned plans The train is filled with the most lethal adversaries and one deadly snake from around the globe and they all want the same thing Chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenariornrnBased on the book by Kôtarô Isaka the film takes place almost solely onboard a train but it never feels claustrophobic Despite tight closeups and many dialogueheavy scenes with questionable writing the cast including Joey King Andrew Koji Michael Shannon and Hiroyuki Sanada keeps things engaging Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron TaylorJohnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining and Pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb The storytelling is terrific one of my favorite bits is the tale of Wolf which is wonderfully executed even if everything doesnt quite come together as well as it couldrnrnThis is also a gorgeous looking film Jonathan Selas colorful cinematography is alluring with a richness that elevates every scene Leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling and fights that are well choreographed Even the CGI is excitingrnrnThe film reaches just the right balance between action violence and humor and its one that I cannot wait to revisit From the killer soundtrack to the rapidfire visual storytelling theres a lot going on at all times If youre not paying attention youre guaranteed to miss something I feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings Plus its been a long time since Ive wanted to rush back to rewatch a movie the second it endedrnrnBullet Train is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste Its the type of movie that youll either love or loathe with very few landing somewhere in between Its illogical confrontational and its sometimes evident that the film trying too hard but I found it easy to overlook the flaws because its just so damn

Netflix effort gives us some eye candy in the form of the annoyingly ageless Ryan Gosling and a slightly hammy Chris Evans but the rest of it is derivative even by their standards We start with a young man being released from prison by Fitzroy Tommy Lee Jones so he can join an elite CIA hit squad Named Six Gosling his first mission is straight out of the Mechanic 2011 only its an erstwhile colleague that he is sent to eradicate A task that proves remarkably simple but is accomplished not before luckily for us he is given a micro chip that illustrates his new boss Carmichael an underwhelming RegéJean Page is about as crooked as the day is long There now ensues a series of long John Wick style combat scenes as try as this hugely well equipped CIA operation does it simply cannot capture Six Desperate times call for desperate measures so Hansen Evans is drafted in to finally do the business by kidnapping the easily accessible niece of the now retired TLJ and using her as leverage he tries a different tack Wholesale slaughter follows and along the way some lovely buildings in Prague and Croatia become neat piles of rubble the local citizens are dropping like flies sending those in the CIA PR department into spasms Well you get the gist The always overrated Ana de Armas sports quite a colourful suit at the start but as usual her contributions are pretty unimpressive TLJ is nowhere near his best and the thing lurches on towards a really inevitable conclusion that stretched out the thinnest of plots and showed a really disconcerting image of a CIA completely out of control running rampage  and that scenario isnt remotely plausible There is plenty of carchasing gunfights and pyrotechnic displays but thats nowhere near enough to compensate for a pretty unremarkable script and an amalgam of stories we have seen done better elsewhere many times before That said if you get a chance to see it during its limited cinema run then Id give it a go On television this is just subscription fodder with Alist cows that you will instantly forget Seing this as another run to the mill Netflix release should not keep your hopes up Netflix is where mediocre goes to congreate to the massesrnWe have another spy action movie amongst us Last one before this was Kate that was another bland actionspy moviernThis offers absolutely NOTHING new to the table We seen every trick this movie offer before Overskilled agents Clever coreographed fight scenes Trick tactics agents with no names An agency who elimintaes their own agents expendable kill teams plenty

also have Ana De Armas who is fast becoming the new Tom Holland that appears everywhere An actress that is milked trought the Hollywood system and spewed out to never be heard of again some dayrnBut the movie is for sure a worthy popcorn flick with no expetations to give On a entertainment standpoint it delivers Anyone thinking the CIA is anything other than awful should in my humble opinion take a long look at their actual historyrnrnAnyway putting aside the predictable effort to set up this nasty little three letter acronym as virtuous theres not a lot going on herernrnIts your usual rather

throughout the film a large percentage of them missed the mark completely There were scenes that had me laughing aloud and others that were a little cringe at times so the humor levels will for sure vary per viewer The overall plot was somewhat standard but entertaining enough as comedy plots are concerned The beginning starts off strong and then slowly fades as the plot becomes more unbelievable The acting is excellent as it should be with this type of star power Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum had spectacular comedic chemistry and bounced off each other nicely Daniel Radcliffes over the top villain antics were fairly decent as well nothing groundbreaking Brad Pitt was a standout and I wish we saw more of him in this film but his scenes by far were the most memorable Even though this movie has its ups and downs it understands what it is and does not take itself seriously This translates to the audience not taking it seriously as well which results in a fairly fun viewing experiencernrnVerdict _Decent_ It was okay Had some charm and Sandra Bullock shows she still has star power Not sure I completely bought her and Channing Tatum but they were fine together Story isnt the best and Daniel Radcliff made for a lame villain but I guess I was entertained for the duration Not sure if Id ever really revisit however 305 My grandpa wanted to do something with me to

Definitely one of the better comedies Ive gotten the chance to see on the big screen I had a great time  Loved it even more on a second viewing the stuff that works really works Brad Pitt and Channing Tatums performances are golden here what more can you ask for The Lost City is a good time full of laughter but feels like a typical romcom adventure that hits all the tropesrnrnThe Lost City is a goofy adventure with shades of romantic comedy much like Romancing The Stone back in 1984 but with the absurdity and the laughs cranked up to 10 The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatums hilarious reaction to every peril and danger Sandra Bullock charms as always and Daniel Radcliffes kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitts overthetop hero His character is a gutbusting foil to Tatums attempts to impress Sandra Bullock The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatums wacky antics and Pitts uproarious cameo So this is Romancing the Stone only its Romancing the Stone where Wilder shows everyone all the time to make a statement that is really the same statement that every other movie has been making nonstop for the past 6 or so years flopping as a result about and then blaming the people who didnt go see it after they were told it wasnt made for them and thus realized it was going to be just like all the othersrnrnAnd it was We have seen this so many times it spawned a cliche about going brokernrnThe characters have no chemistry because they arent supposed to be real people they are supposed to be checked boxes interacting with other checked boxes yawn like every other movie and TV show made in the past few yearsrnrnThe plot is boring because people have seen the movie it is blatantly ripping off of and because of that they have seen the plot work in a far better movie that doesnt put political statements above entertainmentrnrnIn the end its another movie made to be another lecture about what you are supposed to think Romance novelist Loretta Sage Sandra Bullock gets kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax Daniel Radcliffe She is taken to an island where her archaeological skills are needed to find a treasure hidden in a lost tomb Sages cover model Alan Channing Tatum mercenary Jack Brad Pitt and Sages publisher Beth DaVine Joy Randolph try to come to Lorettas aid This riff on Romancing the Stone and a few other Hollywood projects about writers shouldnt work this well The screenplay credit is messy but Bullock uses her impeccable comic timing to deliver Tatum brings more to the dumb guy role than was required Pitt should have had more fun with his pretty boymercenary role and Radcliffe doesnt get lost in the shuffle Harrison as Sages social media ambassador steals her scenes from the name performers Randolph is good but like Pitt I wanted more from her character The Nee brothers direction is heavy on technology The color correction and lighting are harsh and some of the special effects arent convincing The pacing has more fits and starts than my first used car so when a running gag or setpiece lands its more successful than it should have been Alan has a great scene with Loretta after she refers to her romance fiction as shlock and he sets her straight about disrespecting the audience who loves her stories I wish a few hundred Hollywood types some of whom are in this film would watch that scene and then watch the

menace well fuelled by confident efforts from Thames and his sister Gwen Madeleine McGraw who might have inherited her mothers ability to see the future in dreams  a skill that may prove vital in helping the police save her brother from certain death There are violent undertones but very little actual violence is shown as the young man comes to terms with some of his own demons and to try to

movie does a great job setting up the main characters in the beginning that gives you a relationship with them and genuine desire for them to succeed There are a few plot points that are a little questionable but are they are minor nitpicks and didnt pull me out of the story too much The performances all around were great Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up The children do very well too especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes A few of the

dramatic moments with his characters comedic personality However the constant tonal changes create uncertainty about the type of film were supposed to be watching Personally its a mixed bagrnrnRating C When you buy a ticket for a movie like The Popes Exorcist its pretty clear what youre getting into Theres a ton of Catholic imagery like the rosary crucifixes holy water church rituals and lots of

take on the religious horror subgenrernrnElevated by a well thoughtout story and an engaging performance from Russell Crowe the film tells the story of Father Gabriele Amorth Crowe Chief Exorcist of the Vatican and one of the most controversial figures in the Churchs modern era The script is inspired by the Fathers actual files of his time spent conducting exorcisms for the Catholic Church which

and creepy imagery that are all done quite well Its slightly goofy but played with sincerity which is why the film never teeters on the edge of camp This isnt a case of a movie thats so bad its good it actually is goodrnrnWhile it may seem like there isnt a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who possessed by a demon is screaming obscenities in a growling voice the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference Every element clicks in unison here from the screenplay to the direction to the better than expected performancesrnrnThe Popes Exorcist is the type of movie that should be forgettable but isnt I actually enjoyed it because it overdelivers on what it promises and is a lot better than youd expectrnrnTowards the end of the movie I literally starting thinking wow Crowe and Zovatto should star in future installments as

seeing the trailers I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again and while most of that is still true there is something about this film that made it a joy to watchrnrnThe film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre but everything it has is handled with care and precision The direction is fantastic with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your runofthemill insert random priest herernrnMy favorite aspect of the film is the acting I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways Alex Essoe was great although underutilized The two children were okay The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child and the daughter was flat in many waysrnrnMy only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story Every single beat is something that we have seen before there were no new or

movie entry with some good actors and immersive camerawork Unfortunately the digital effects on the lion are distracting and prevent the tension from fully building The film was at its best when characters were frantically trying to spot the lion before it attacked but the attacks themselves were easily survivable making the result disappointing The pointless family drama weak dialogue and farfetched man versus lion battles prevented Beast from being as enjoyable as movies like Crawl or Deep Blue Sea I think the key to figuring out this movie is an early scene in which one of the characters is wearing a Jurassic Park shirt This must be the filmmakers winking their eye at the audience letting us know that what were about to see is all in jest rnrnHow else to explain a film where the protagonists arrive in South Africa and immediately start bitching about the heat but theyre all wearing jackets and sweaters and hoodies More importantly how are we to interpret a movie that introduces the issues of poaching people who kill lions and antipoaching people who kill people who kill lions or at least thats what Beast thinks it is only to have the antagonist be a maneater a lion that kills people regardless of their stance on poachingrnrnThis only perpetuates the myth that lions have never met a human they didnt want to maul while contributing nothing to the poaching debate Im not saying lions follow an animal version of the First Law of Robotics but they do get a bad rap in the movies as do sharks  and in that sense Beast is closer to Jaws The Revenge than Jaws Actually Beast is even worse than Jaws The Revenge because the latter at least used a mechanical shark as opposed to the formers pitiful CGI lion rnrnAll things considered this is a film that makes you yearn for the simplicity of The Ghost and the Darkness which made no pretense of being anything other than a Hemingwaylite story about male bonding over hunting big game and which though taking many liberties with the source material had the decency to feature real lions rnrnHere however the hero tricks two other lions into killing the evil lion not only a gambit that could easily backfire but also not very naturefriendly Although coming to think about it maybe these lions do comply with the second part of the First Law A robot or in this case lion may not  through inaction allow a human being to come to harm omg  one of the worst movies Ive ever seen Please dont pay to see this filmrnrnIdris Elba is generally mediocre anyway but he can put on an acceptable performance with a decent script and concept Sadly neither was available to him in this bumbling tragic and failed effort to create dramatic cinema rnrnIm amazed that anyone could create a movie based on such a predictable and often used concept and do it so badly One poorly contrived scene after another belief is not just suspended but abandoned entirely to piece together a cartoonish presentation of sappy ideas and bad cgi The script is equally dreary simplistic and filled with mostly predictable chatter until it suddenly leaps off the cliff of reality and into the void of astoundingly stupid Sadly that happens far too oftenrnrnDont bother going to the cinema to see this Wait a few weeks for it to get relegated to Pluto TV Amazon Prime Video  or Freevee Honestly it wont take long _Beast_ had its moments where I was left gripping the arms of my chair at the edge of my seat but the majority of film had me verbally laughing at the poor character writing This movie does a lot right dont get me wrong The buildup to the encounter was done really well You get a great introduction to all the characters and the individual struggles they go through due to the loss of Dr Nate Daniels wife it gives a baseline for the viewer to be able to relate and sympathize with the character The action is pretty decent and I was really impressed with the CGI work done on the lion But once the climax ensues the writing goes downhill mainly in terms of character decision making I found that the writers did not really know how to create unique situations to put the characters in with the lion resulting in baffling decision to prolong the duration of the film At every turn a solution is so easily in view but they do something that is such a right turn that it is unbelievable The performance of Idris Alba really pulls the score up though He does a fantastic job and portrays the loving and protecting nature of a father so well I enjoyed his cool calm collected nature during high pressure scenes it

done with a few more curveballs most if not all that we see is pretty predictable  and even then its all filmed and shot in a fairly normal way In short this 2022 release didnt quite do it for me  it

anything I have seen beforethere is excellent symbolism through the flashback sequences I also enjoyed the developing relationship between the main two characters My only complaint is that the horror and dread so palpable at the beginning fades completely about twothirds into the film They said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it Did I find it entertaining nope Did  I feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible with a clear contextual message nope Were characterisations relatable and relevant Sort of rnrnNopes characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow also seem to appear oddly misconstrued The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character for example only adds to the sense of ambiguity perhaps thats the ideaTo my mind however this ploy if thats what it is stifles development of the already ambiguous story line The sister his complete antithesis is superficially verbose but seems equally to lack any depth of self awarenessrnrnThe only thing I can say conclusively about Nope is the visuals are  compelling complex and at times almost intricate This film certainly scores a A in this regard rnrnThat said so much else is lacking in particular a clearly articulated narrative that it failed to resonate with me rnrnIn summary I found Nope a frustrating dissatisfying watch Somewhat  reminiscent of M Night Shyamalan films Nope is visually stunning but

big expectations due to Peeles previous work Get Out shifted the paradigm for horror movies taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfoldrnrnNope is no exception and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings Taking the central theme of spectacle Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment and even int he worst cases eventual demise Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around Peele does a great job of story telling and often subverts out expectations time and time again in the process Aside from the films deeper meaning some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters mostly notably OJ Emerald and Angel Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for mernrnHowever I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme  Spectacle While I did enjoy each story OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other Other than that I did have some questions around OJs motivations to tame  kill this animal the legitimacy of the final impossible shot the nature and behaviour the animal and how  if OJ survived or was this open for interpretation The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand This however could also be tied into the overall message of Spectacle as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to bernrnOverall I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get

execution of its scifi concepts and just a joy to exist in It might be one of the best films Ive had the pleasure of seeing in theaters and definitely one of my favorites I do noi Ike horror movies as a rule but I liked this one so I suspect that Nope didnt have enough gore or shocking surprises for the average fan of that genre  I thought the acting and writing were fine and the title was a subtle selection The odd subplot of the incident with Gordy the monkey reminded me of the movie Magnolia for some reason I wonder if that film was any kind of an influence on Jordan Peeles storytelling

scarily effective treatise on just how easy it is for an internetsavvy teenager to use some fairly basic navigational skills and a fair degree of common sense too use the web to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the missing couple For me too much of this happens on hard to follow busy laptop or phone screens and the story itself has one or two pretty substantial holes  those

into a characters thoughts is one of the keys to a screen life narrative giving the story a beating heart when it could easily lean too much into the technical side and become cold and soullessrnrnAnother wrinkle that Merrick and Johnsons film introduces is the lack of money for the protagonist Being a high schooler June doesnt have much in the way of financial resources and is entirely dependent on the money her mother left prior to going down to Colombia on vacation This presents a challenge when the FBIs investigation into Graces disappearance doesnt make enough headway for June forcing her to hire someone down in Colombia to help find cluesrnrnWith Junes limited funds she isnt able to hire a private investigator and is only able to afford the services of Javier Joaquim de Almeida an online platform worker The inclusion of this character grounds the story as Javier is the type of ordinary person one would expect to come across in todays gig economy Being a father himself Javier connects with June understanding her desperation to locate her missing mother The burgeoning relationship between Javier and June is one of the highlights of this film helping to build the emotional resonance that the story needs to keep viewers engagedrnrnWith the twists in the narrative and rocksolid performances from Reid and de Almeida Missing is one of the rare films that manages to equal the trailblazer that came before Merrick and Johnsons movie doesnt have the novelty of Searching but their take on an online missing person search changes enough elements to make it feel fresh This film is a great ride and anyone who enjoyed Searching should give it a look', NOW());

of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive impactful films from writerdirectors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didnt recognize the crew and cast involved I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that Id save them close to my heart until the very end of the year With this said I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festivalrnrnCODA Child Of Deaf Adults is the first film I watch by Siân Heder and after this session I cant wait to see what she did so far and what shes going to do in the future The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to todays society The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicaprnrnAs the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay having some sort of limitation doesnt automatically characterize someone as weird different or that the respective family members dont love each other as much or more than the socalled normal families Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character that could have brought up an entirely different unnecessary and even distracting topic to the films central vital themes I was incredibly invested in every single storylinernrnIn fact I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast Leaving the protagonist to the end Daniel Durant Leo Rossi brother and Marlee Matlin Jackie Rossi mother are great as supporting characters but Troy Kotsur Frank Rossi father and Eugenio Derbez Bernardo Villalobos music teacher literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles and Im delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isnt just another stereotypical cliche hysterical choir adultrnrnHowever the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together elevating the whole film to a whole other level Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family Ruby Rossi First of all I love music and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group acapella or not so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review Nevertheless not only Jones voice is sumptuously heartwarming but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations I cant remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner and Jones is definitely a major reasonrnrnA final praise to Paula Huidobros visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries who composed the movies subtle yet efficient score and who Im guessing had a hand in the song choices Either way terrific jobrnrnCODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021s edition of the Sundance Film Festival and it will undoubtedly become a mustwatch movie when its available worldwide Siân Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last fortyfive minutes Boasting an educative meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicapdisability the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing deeply elevating the overall piece With the help of heartfelt genuine performances from the supporting cast mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long long time A tearinducing thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the worldrnrnRating A I cannot think of one person to whom I wouldnt recommend CODA an uplifting emotionally rich movie from writer  director Sian Heder This crowdpleasing film is one of the first real gems to debut at this years Sundance Film Festival and Im still riding the wave of good vibes hours laterrnrnBeing a teenager is difficult enough but try being Ruby Emilia Jones The 17yearold is the only hearing member of a deaf family and she spends most of her spare time working on her parents Marlee Matlin Troy Kotsur fishing boat along with her older brother Leo Daniel Durant and serving as their sign language interpreter Ruby juggles her family responsibilities her schoolwork and a newfound passion for her high schools choir club and her cute duet partner Miles Ferdia WalshPeelo When her music teacher Eugenio Derbez hears that special something in Rubys voice he encourages her to think about a life beyond fishing and supports her in applying to a prestigious music school This unfairly puts the responsibility of the household on Rubys shoulders and she must choose between keeping her family afloat or pursuing her dreamsrnrnThis very funny and very honest story has a universal appeal with charming performances and a likeable family that youll want to spend time with Kotsur and Matlin are terrific as Rubys randy parents and Derbez brings a genuine charisma to his role as the young womans mentor The cast includes three deaf actors so much of the dialogue is expressed in sign language  and everything about that feels normal This film goes a long way in shattering stereotypes about people who are hearing impaired and that is to be commendedrnrnHeder has created a film thats filled with insight refreshingly direct dialogue and a fully developed cast of characters that all add up to solid storytelling all around Not only is this a comingofage story for Ruby but its one for her family too The four of them struggle through the disappointment that life throws their way hoping to work together to emerge stronger than everrnrnHeartfelt but never corny CODA is a really special movie about unwavering support unconditional love and what it means to be a family Full Review and Analysis at SpotaMoviecomrnProduced and released by Apple in 2021 CODA is an inspiring movie It delivers music and voice to deaf people highlighting important topics The Story Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family They run a small business as fishermen and she helps and supports them mainly translating everything to her family in the deaf signs language As a result she splits her life between her family and her dreamsrnRuby discovers an incredible talent something that makes her feel alive and happy But the two worlds are not easily manageable for her because society and her parents are not ready to understand each other Rubys role becomes crucial for her family especially when a new law threatens their business and future Therefore to keep her dreams moving forward she will need to fight sacrifice and change the reality around her story Fortunately Ruby meets an incredible character during her journey and something powerful will happen Its an engaging story Opinion Its a film of revolution passion family and friendships It teaches us about integration and shows us the difficulty deaf people face every day The pieces of music are perfect and the film has pace and rhythm The performance delivered by the actors is incredible and makes the movie more engaging Its a must watch in our opinion because it makes us better person Whilst I did quite enjoy this I am struggling to see what all the fuss is about Emilia Jones is Ruby a talented young singer who is keen to attend music college Her family live in a maritime town where the local fishermen are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet When her fathers business looks doomed she has to choose between staying at home or fulfilling her dream What makes the film interesting is that she is the only one in her family who can hear Her parents Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin as well as her brother Leo Daniel Durant are all deaf Whilst that certainly adds an extra dimension to the narrative the story itself is really nothing much to write home about Their deafness is in no way the cause of the family woes and much of the narrative is taken up with this family struggling to survive the decline of their livelihood whilst she has boyfriend issues and her demanding music teacher Eugenio Derbez is constantly challenging to do her best It does feature an haunting version of Joni Mitchells Both Sides Now and on occasion we are presented with an audio appreciation from her familys perspective which does resonate well giving us an inkling of how sounds sound or not to people who are deaf It is a fine looking production is enjoyable to watch and the dynamic between the parents and their daughter is frequently amusing and touching It ought to raise awareness but as a piece of cinema is nothing particularly special Admittedly there is nothing brilliantly creative about the script which is why I gave it only 8 stars The elevator story a teenager trying to find and assert herself in the world and her family who itself is struggling to remain commercially viable in an industry thats been devastated by commercialism and global warming The wrinkle in the story is that the protagonists parents and brother are all deaf CODA  Child of Deaf AdultsrnrnThats where hohum departs and I have two things to say about it First this film deserves all the accolades and awards its received Second this may the first time Ive known a remake to exceed by far the originalrnrnThe acting from nearly everyone in the cast is unbelievably great The production values are fantastic The film is incredibly hilarious thanks to brilliant performance by Troy Kotsur and also surprisingly emotional In what could have been just another meh comingofage story Emilia Jones worked super hard to create a character that draws the audience inrnrnTo Siân Heders credit everything about this production

whom tremendous compassion is produced but it isnt an easily digestible movie due to its disturbing uncomfortable momentsrnrnDarren Aronofsky presents a depressing passionate and above all brutally honest story about trauma acceptance and positivity The filmmakers lack of restraint may be a trigger for some but the impact of his messages couldnt be more memorablernrnBring tissuesrnrnRating B The Whale is a heart breaking story of our main character Charlie Brendon Fraser as he tries to make amends for abandoning his daughter Charlie is obese an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly The emotion he delivers is palpable which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair Not only is Fraser a highlight but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job Hong Chau is superb and despite her tough no nonsense science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body but is defenseless to his desires resulting in her to continually feed his addiction It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care Sadie Sink is great as well she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities I understand that this was the point of her character and by no means is this a knock on Sinks performance but it felt like a bit much She was too cruel to the point of unbelievability which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered The pace was a bit slow for my liking I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects But despite my minor complaints the movie is carried by fantastic performances amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience but will not be for everyonernrnScore 82rnVerdict Great Yikes but this second gaythemed outing for Brendan Fraser could hardly be more different from his 1998 Gods and Monsters one Here his is the critically obese Charlie who has grown to a size where his health is in tatters and he has virtually no mobility as he regularly consumes two large pizzas for dinner and two great meatball subs for lunch We learn quite quickly a little of what initially drove this man to this level of despair and as things begin to look terminal we share his aspirations to reconcile with his daughter whom he left eight years earlier to be with his gay lover Allan Now for all I thought Fraser was superb in this film I found Sadie Sinks performance as the truly selfish conniving and odious daughter Ellie upon whom he rather dotes stole this for me At times I really did want to shoot her Ty Simpkins also does well as the well meaning godsquadder who finds his association with this dysfunctional family helps open his eyes too Hong Chau performs well as his long suffering friendnurseconfidante Liz and as mortality looms the characters are drawn into an increasingly angry hostile environment that is full of bitterness rancour and regret certainly but maybe  just maybe  the slightest hint of reconciliation Fraser will never deliver another performance like this again Sure his size and generally slothful demeanour are so far from the halefellowwellmet series of characters we have seen thus far in his career that they are bound to have an effect His acting though is honest and emotional His character is torn and distraught and he conveys that potently especially in the scenes with his obnoxious daughter The plot has an inevitability to it which doesnt usually work so well for me  but here it helps focus on the few interlinked stories and characters allowing little room for distraction Its not without its humour now and again either Ive deliberately avoided reading about how he got to that size  somehow knowing might spoil what is undoubtedly a tour de force from both him and Miss Sink Brave and uncompromising  well worth a watch I doubt I can add much more to what has already been said about emThe Whaleem but in a word BravornrnBrendan Fraser truly is sensational in this role I heard about all the acclaim and seen a few of the standing ovations he has received and all I can say is that it is unequivocally deserved Truly outstanding from the first scene yes even with that ha to the very last Its great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in ema hrefhttpsletterboxdcomfilmgeorgeofthejungleGeorge of the Jungleaem well and truly back in the gamernrnOne thing about Fraser getting all the undoubtedly merited plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didnt know what to expect from the support cast and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser Sadie Sink Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio  brilliant stuff from herrnrnThere are some powerful scenes in there Im not one to cry with fictional works my brain automatically knows its fake I cant help it but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches pardon the pun from whats portrayed onscreen Fraser and Chau are naturally the major reasons for that but everyone  on and off the screen  deserves big props for this 2022 filmrnrnThe definition of a mustwatch I like this onernIt really made me feel something write something honestrnrnAny movie directed by Darren Aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see Darren Aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films Requiem of Dream 2000 is one of my favoritesrnrnThe most important event in the movie The Whale is the star Brendan Fraser after suffering from many health problems especially with the spine and was forced to perform surgeries in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him and his playing movie roles that didnt achieve wide successrnrnBrendan Fraser played a terrible role that deserves an Academy Award due to his genius performance and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles He did a lot of dramatic work but he didnt reach perfection like the one in the movie The WhalernrnThis amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is Brendan Fraser It was the makeup and the way the breathing was unbelievable and its mind blowing how someone can pull off such a rolernrnThe film was shot in only one location with the exception of the flashback scenes Sadie Sink It was provocative from the first minutes getting on your nerves and pushing you to throw something on the visual medium through which you watch the movie whether it is a mobile phone a laptop or even in theatersrnrnHong Chau has an incredible charisma and addition to any work even if she didnt appear much and I wish to see her in many scenes she is wonderful By Louisa Moore  wwwScreenZealotscomrnrn_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_rnrnWhen thinking about The Whale I feel its important to start at the end rather than the beginning because the melodramatic finale almost ruins everything thats good about the film The finale is grossly manipulative corny excessive and if what came before wasnt so great it would diminish director Darren Aronofskys entire project Thanks to a heartbreaking script from writer Samuel D Hunter and a onceinalifetime lead performance from Brendan Fraser it takes little effort to overlook the films more negative aspectsrnrnBased on Hunters 2012 play of the same name the psychological drama tells the story of Charlie Fraser a reclusive English professor who is living with severe obesity Weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home Charlie spends his days alone in his small dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse Liz Hong Chau who is his only companion Its been an interesting week for the man as hes had two additional unexpected visitors a religious missionary Ty Simpkins who is compelled to continue his visits and Charlies estranged and hostile teenager daughter Ellie Sadie Sink With his health in grave decline he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital Charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughters eyes and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with herrnrnThe film takes place in a confined space and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa This cramped setting feels suffocating which in turn conveys the feelings that Charlie is also experiencing This is a story about empathy and its admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for Charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be His outward appearance is shocking and repellant and its part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction Whats interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath Charlies obesity and lets you into his heart I was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much I had grown to care so deeply for himrnrnFolks who have seen the film and are crying that it is fat shaming are missing the point This isnt a story about humiliation or degradation its a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity This is not a project that mocks obesity as has so often and sadly been the case with many Hollywood films This is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression mental illness and addiction In this case Charlie has spent years selfmedicating his despair and unhappiness with food and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of controlrnrnNone of this would be so emotionally touching if not for Frasers lead performance He is impressive and outstanding as Charlie and its one of the greatest cinematic performances in years and definitely of the actors career Its not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable its how Fraser thoroughly embodies Charlie with a deep soulful pain in his eyes His performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where I found it difficult to breathe Hes _that_ goodrnrnWhile theres been so much talk about Fraser Chaus performance is equally heartbreaking Through her facial expressions and body language you can see and feel the pain Charlie is causing Liz Everyone is simply waiting for the man to die and youre right there by Lizs side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection Its an agonizing thing to watch and experience and Chau conveys her torment in an understated poignant wayrnrnIf it sounds like this is a tough film to watch I will assure you that it is You wont leave the theater floating on air when its over This is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment vulnerability regret and humanity Thats also why The Whale is one of the very best films of the year At least partly because this movie was based on a play most of the action takes place in one room Of course the nature of the characters health issues makes it hard for him to move around but I think the limited setting worked against the film Maybe it is just my eyes getting older but the cinematography of The Whale seems to follow the current trend of being dark dark dark Are they desperate to show the mood through lighting were they trying to simulate the inside of a whales stomach or is it less expensive to film in the gloomy interiors or what Would it kill them to turn on a light now and againrnrnAnyway the movie tugs at the appropriate heartstrings and throws a curve here and there and is an excellent work of drama noir', NOW());

visit a waterfall and pretty soon her mother and the feisty park ranger Liz Margo Martindale are all trying to find them and stay one step ahead of the increasingly stoned apex predator Its got funny moments scary moments  downright silly moments Martindale and the young Convery are good fun too and there is even a bit of a moral to the story from Eddie Alden Ehrenreich who is determined to opt out of the drug dealing business of his ruthless dad Syd Ray Liotta Its not often folks laugh out loud in a cinema these days and folks did  as did I  tonight Rocket science it isnt but entertaining it certainly is and the bear has some nifty moves too After the initial hit of Cocaine Bear the film left me scratching for something a little strongerrnrnI think the main drawback of this film is that it is trying to do too much There are seven to eight characters introduced throughout the course of the film with each given significant time to develop their story and motivations This takes a lot of time away from the main attraction the cocaine bear There is a period of almost 45 minutes where we are focused on these secondary characters without any action or appearance of the cocaine bear This section was pretty slow paced and started to lose me but once the bear is reintroduced the film gets significantly better The paramedic scene was superbrnrnThe comedy was pretty lackluster as well The entire theater was laughing aloud but I found myself only chuckling at a few jokes This left the script feeling somewhat bland But the lack of humor is made up for by the absolute brutality on display There are some really messed up kills that do not shy away from the blood and gore Some of the effects looked to be prosthetics as well which always have an especially disgusting appearance to themrnrnThe story overall was pretty decent but the ending was atrocious and incredibly predictable I found that it was really over the top and cheesy but not in a good way rnrnThe

was a little underwhelmed It wasnt bad for what it was but it didnt dazzle me as I had hoped Two things held it back for mernrn1 The tone inconsistently switched from a Zombielandstyle ridiculous violence to a goofy crime movie to an odd family drama Cocaine Bear had a minor identity crisis from start to finishrnrn2 The movie tried to give each character a little backstory and development While this is generally a good thing in a lowbudget creature movie it slows down the nonsensical violence that the audience came for in the first place Spend time on one or two characters but not all of them I didnt need to know about the drug lords grandson or the detectives dog I just need to see more people get eaten rnrnI appreciated the largerbudget kills and the oddball characters If it continues I will come back for a second try in this franchise but ultimately I wasnt high on Cocaine Bear get it  If you are viewing this film with some of the Oscar flicks in mind then you might see it as terrible But if you are watching it for some good ole entertainments sake then this one is surely not a miss A definite viewing which will make you smile and horrified at the same time I loved it as a one time watch Not so much the 2nd time though If you are one of those who like to go critical on notsological jokes then give this a miss But if you find life good to have a hearty laugh then

direction  The humor was clearly there on paper  That was evident enough but the delivery was meh  The jokes didnt land because they ran too long the timing was off everything was there for it to be funny and fun it just feels like it was made by a director that cant tell a jokernrnAnd it falls on the director because the writer clearly can  Everything is there to make it work  But all the action is predictable and all the jokes are butcheredrnrnIn the hands of anyone else this would have been hysterical fun To say that Cocaine Bear isnt the usual style of movie I like to watch is an understatement My wife thought it had been involved in Academy Award talk of some kind and suggested we give it a try Not sure where the Oscar talk came from but we stuck with it barely The violence is that excessive sort that horror fans demand I guess It was easy to get past it once you internalize that it is all special effects and make believe of course There was just enough humor to keep us watching though I am sure if they come out with a sequel we wont get drawn in a second time', NOW());

me back to the precious times I shared with my late grandfatherrnrnAn extraordinarily creative moving story surrounded by incredibly genuine humor and filled with meaningful memorable messages about family friendship life and love Complex themes dissected through the fascinatingly simplistic eye of a small shell Efficiently short runtime to take the viewers through a contemplative yet quite spirited experiencernrnOne of my favorite films of the year do NOT miss itrnrnRating A If this doesnt appeal to the inner kid in you I dont know what will Its all about the charmingly orangetoed mollusc Marcel who is now living with human Dean and his grandmother Connie who even has a titchy zimmerframe in an house that was previously occupied by a couple Now it transpires that this pair had a fairly lively relationship and when things started to get a bit hairy he and his extended family at the time would seek safety in the sock drawer After one such altercation though the contents of that drawer were unceremoniously emptied into a bag leaving Marcel in his current rather lonely predicament Every evening he and his granny watch Sixty Minutes and it occurs to them that presenter Lesley Stahl might just be able to help the family reunite What follows now is a thoroughly enjoyable characterful and engaging little drama that sees Marcel  quite a shrewd and quickwitted fella  and Dean set about turning his circumstances into a matter of international significance Question is  well will it pay off Of course there is no jeopardy its just a fun story  tinged with a touch of tragedy that elicits feelings of longing family loneliness sure but also of family optimism and all set in an environment that is ideal for wandering around the walls after youve stuck your tiny feet in honey I really did enjoy this By Louisa Moore  wwwScreenZealotscomrnrnWith strong themes of friendship family and always doing whats right theres so much to love about the poignant and sweet animated mockumentary Marcel the Shell With Shoes On Everything about this film is simply delightful from its simple stopmotion animation to terrific voice performances from Jenny Slate and Isabella RossellinirnrnBased on the hit YouTube film series from the 2010s the film tells the story of the tiny shell Marcel voice of Slate and the daytoday life that he leads with his grandmother Nana Connie voice of Rossellini The pair live in a house in the suburbs that after the couple who used to reside there had a very nasty breakup is now being rented out as an Airbnb When human documentary filmmaker Dean Dean FleischerCamp rents the place he befriends Marcel learning that his entire shell family disappeared two years ago Armed with a camera Dean decides to help his new pal find his lost clan shooting a documentary about their epic questrnrnIts a simple story told in an elemental style but director FleischerCamp has created a world of pure joy Marcel is as cute as they come a sweet positive little guy with the sunniest of dispositions He travels around in a tennis ball climbs the walls by smearing honey on his feet uses toenail clippings for skis and has a pet ball of lint Its the little things that are so inventive and clever so be sure to pay attention to the small details Its a lot like the scenes where Marcel gets carsick when he rides on Deans dashboard theres something irresistible about seeing the world through a shells eyes and it becomes an effortless endeavor to find an appreciation for everything in your own surroundings toornrnWhile this sounds like a movie thats great for kids its probably better for older tweens and up Its a film thats more pensive than colorful or actionpacked and there are moments that talk openly and frankly about grief fear and death With the help of Nana Connie Marcel gains the courage to take risks that are scary but important and he gains a ton of confidence along the way The story also has a timely life lesson about the world of social media and Marcel is given a heavy dose of reality when he learns that many of his online fans want to exploit him rather than actually help him find his familyrnrnJust ten minutes into the movie I was concerned that the eccentricity would wear thin quickly but it does not FleischerCamp Slate and Nick Paleys screenplay is so wise and tender and emotionally touching that even when the story ended I wanted more I cannot say enough positive things about this entire project because there are no missteps here Thats why Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is one of my favorite films

David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messagesrnrnFighting sequences feature truly violent practical stunts taking advantage of the R rating to provide unmeasurable amounts of gore Creative use of Christmas songs will leave audiences crying with laughterrnrnA brilliant homage to the seasonal genre classics that should be seen in a packed theaterrnrnRating A Santa David Harbour is getting a bit disillusioned with the whole Christmas thing He is tired of delivering gifts to modern day children who live in an unappreciative throwaway culture and so has taken to the bottle rather Leaving Bristol one night he rather drunkenly crashlands thousands of miles away at the compound of the wealthy and therefore entirely dysfunctional LIghtstone family Now here we have group of people ruled over by matriarch Gertrude Beverly DAngelo  who just reminded me of Goldie Hawn who are dealing with their own issues of separation avarice precociousness and yes I too was already thinking  same old same old Wait though it seems that this family are the target of some seriously nasty robbers who are after the 300 million hidden in an impenetrable vault in the cellar Santa unwittingly becomes embroiled in these shenanigans and after being initially desperate to get out of the place he spots the terrified young Trudy Leah Brady and well someones goose is about to be cooked It cant resists wallowing a bit in sentiment at times and the familial discord stuff is all very old hat but when the action scenes kick in we are offered a sort of Home Alone 1990 meets Thor 2011 experience peppered with some genuinely laughoutloud moments as of course the plot follows its own very obvious course Its violent and gory but the fact that much of that emanates from this epitome of kindness and avuncularity makes this just a bit different  and quite entertaining  with Harbour carrying it off quite engagingly It is a bit long and there are times when you want it to pedal faster but its a fun watch that is certainly not for the youngsters Violent Night is a savage Christmas action flick with Die Hard vibes and an awesome hardcore Santa herornrnViolent Night was precisely what I expected and everything I hoped for  ridiculously delightful dumb fun filled with brutal action and violence A new Christmas classic This is a movie best seen with friends that can laugh and recoil at the gruesome kills and outrageous dialogue Violent Night knows exactly how cheesy it is and embraces all the tropes in a way that is fun and entertaining without being cliche It adds new twists to classic Santa lore and leaves me wanting to know more with hopes for a prequel As with any 87North film the fight sequences are topnotch This movie isnt for everyone but fans of Bullet Train or Nobody will add Violent Night to their yearly holiday film watchlist _Violent Night_ overcomes its weak script and familiar concept with enough ooey gooey squelchy violence to appease bloodthirsty horror fans and action junkies alike It still manages to be a bloody festive blast filled with head squashing Christmas carnagernrnFull review httpsboundingintocomicscom20221209violentnightreviewsantadeliversanooeygooeysquelchyheadsquashing It would seem psychotic Santa is coming to town this Xmas rnrnPutting aside the woke nonsense and shallow script Violent Night is a moderately watchable darkly comedic action flick that draws inspiration from 80s style  franchises such as Die Hard and Lethal Weapon rnrnIts well paced predictably violent but lacks a lot of the well crafted personality and charm of its predecessors rnrnIn short an easy viewing action flick offering a festive dose of mindless violence wrapped up in Xmas tinsel Violent Night was exactly what I was looking for heading into this movie It is laughoutloud funny with spectacular action and brutal gory kills a perfect blend for a Christmas filmrnrnWhen David Harbor is on screen this movie works wonderfully I never knew I needed a David Harbor Santa Claus but now that we got it I want to see more He portrays a charming grumpy Santa wonderfully His lack of care and worldview had me laughing in so many instances This performance carried the film and was the only reason I was therernrnUnfortunately the writers tried to do a little too much with all the secondary characters There are subplots sprinkled throughout that take away from the action adding unnecessary minutes to this film This creates an unbalanced pace that jumps from interesting action to boring side character development really messing with the flow This film is nearly 2 hours long and that length is felt at times If these side plots were to be eliminated and we streamlined the action the film would have been all the better for itrnrnAll in all Violent Night effectively achieves its main goal and provides a brutal Christmas movie that I will be revisiting every seasonrnrnScore 68  rnVerdict Good  rnTheater Verdict See It Yeah Im going to give this top marks not because it is really that good but because it came out in 2022 and was probably the best thing in the theater at the time which was probably why the other Movie Data Base started deleting positive reviews of it  rnrnBut a lot of it is done right it features an interracial family but doesnt make the race a key part of the story  In fact it doesnt even mention it at all  Instead it follows the story of a little girl and Santa rnrnAnd the Santa is a bit weird there is a lot of things that just dont fit with his character but that doesnt matter because the story is just so fun that you willingly suspend most of your disbeliefrnrnIt is violent and does a great job of making the violence both exciting and at times comical  It drops Easter eggs in some of the best possible ways  Not all the men are evil and idiotic and not all the women are practically perfect in every way  They are just written as well as unique charactersrnrnAnd you really have to appreciate it in 2022 when most movies drop characters for checked boxes  rnrnIt was probably the only movie that you could go into in 2022 and just be entertained by  That was the clear intent in making this and that was the end resultrnrnTwenty years ago it would have been Meh but in 2022 it is the best thing in theaters', NOW());
